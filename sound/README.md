# Sounds

Most of the crap in here is from ages gone past, and much of the documentation pertaining to who made them and how they were made has been lost.

If you make stuff, please, for the love of christ, plop in some documentation in case we need to reproduce it for some reason.

# VOX

vox_fem/ and AI/ are generated with the [SS13 VOX Toolkit](https://github.com/N3X15/ss13-vox).  Instructions for installing and generating those voices are included in that repository.
