To utilize the map voter:

1. Uncomment or put MAP_VOTING in config.txt
2. Compile the DMB's for each map you want to be voted on(requires a recompile on every update)
3. Put each map's DMB in a folder designated to the map's name in maps/voting/ eg MetaStation for Meta Station and Box for Box Station
4. At the natural end of a round the map will be voted upon.

TODO:

Maybe add a verb for admins to force another map using file browse.
Setup a script to easily mass compile the maps (hint hint nexy)
