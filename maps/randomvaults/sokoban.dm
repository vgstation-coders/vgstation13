 <br><br>
 Apparently I have to put all the crates on the teleporters. Sounds easy enough, right? Well, he took away my forklift for 'maintenance', and coated every crate with lube, making them impossible to pull. The only way to move them is to push them from behind. If one of them gets stuck in a corner? Tough luck.
 <br>
 He also forbade using wrapping paper or any method of crate moving other than pushing. This is embarrassing and I feel utterly humiliated.
 <br><br>
 Did I mention that he is holding my invention, my prototype Vest of Reflection, hostage? He told me that if I were to break any of the rules, "something might happen to it"?
 So if I make one wrong move, my life's work will be destroyed.
 <br>
 I have until the end of the day to sort the crates out. I don't know if I can do this. I probably can't. Goodbye, cruel world.
