//TOMB OF RAFID: THE AWAY MISSION

//First area: expedition camp. Features a mime and some supplies to get you started, nothing else

//Second area: the pyramid. Some corridors and rooms. There is a sealed gate in the middle; a sacrifice is needed to unlock it. Valid sacrifices are: Ian or any living conscious crewmember (no monkey humans or braindeads)

//Third area: Tomb of Rafid. The largest and the toughest area, it features flying skulls and mummies of various kinds. The mad king Rafid is buried somewhere in there

//Optional area: Spider Caverns. Contains a spider queen and a hermit wizard's house. If you defeat the spider queen, the hermit and the spider hunters, you gain access to a staff of animation

//Optional area: Tower of Madness. Contains many mummy priests and faithless, in the end there's an altar. Praying at the altar will cause you to completely lose your mind and gain many superpowers.
