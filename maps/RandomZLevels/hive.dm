//THE HIVE: THE AWAY MISSION

//A chaotic spaceship built by something VERY scary from VERY far away (but now it's VERY close to the station so you gotta go there and kick some alien ass)
//Very rough and spiky on the outside
//Interior is full of corridors with dead ends and many branches. There are also supermatter lakes that don't spread because they're kept in place by advanced alien technology!
//You'll also find the following inside:

//Alien wall: indestructible wall that looks spoopy
//Alien floor: indestructible floor

//Hive pylon: structure that emits very powerful radiation
//Living floor: a special floor that slows down YOU and speeds up the aliens
//Supermatter lake:  instantly kills you if you touch it or walk into it, no matter your armour, race, gender or admin flags. Thankfully the aliens have been so kind that they've built catwalks over some of it

//Alien Denizen: basic alien, fairly robust and has a 15% chance to stun on attack

//Alien Defender: highly mobile enemy. when it comes adjacent to the enemy, it will switch into 'attack mode' and start attacking very fast. When the target moves away, it will switch back into 'movement mode' and start chasing again
//                   Can't attack while in 'movement mode'. 30% chance to stun on attack

//Alien Turret: very slow tank enemy that shoots napalm bombs
//

//Alien Constructor: alien that permanently turns alien floors below it into living floors. They don't wander around and only start moving
//  when they see a target. When their target is attacked by a different alien, they'll remotely build walls behind the victim, blocking off escape

	<b>Situation Summary</b><br><br>
	A hostile alien spacecraft, codename "The Hive", was detected in orbit above your station, preparing for an attack. Usually at this point it's too late to do anything, as even nuclear weapons are powerless against it.<br>
	But today, there is hope for you. We have just managed to get a first ever partial scan of the Hive, revealing possible points of entry and the ship's important areas. This information should help you assemble a strike team and destroy the Hive before it destroys you.<br>
	You are to complete the following objectives:<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Destroy the Hive Mind to impair the ship's communication abilities</li>
	<li>Destroy the Hive Replicator that mass-produces alien troops</li>
	<li>Disarm the Hive CPU and bring it to Central Command on the escape shuttle. If that is not possible, destroy it</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	A gateway drone has been crashed into one of the entrances into the ship. Your station's gateway will be linked to it shortly.<br><br>
	We have also attached an image with the approximate locations of your targets. The entry point is marked with an arrow. Number 1 is the suspected location of the Hive Mind. Number 2 is the suspected location of the control room. Number 3 is the suspected location of the Hive Replicator.<br>
	The scans have shown signs of dangerous levels of background radiation, ambient magnetic fields, a hostile atmosphere and presence of alien life forms. Prepare for the assault thoroughly, as no living man before has ever entered the Hive, and nobody knows what might await you inside.<br>"}
