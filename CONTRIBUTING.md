CONTRIBUTING TO VGSTATION
=========================

1. **Only submit PRs that are ready to be pulled.**  PRs that are not ready will be closed.
2. **Pull requests must be atomic.**  Change one set of related things at a time.  Bundling sucks for everyone.
3. **Test your changes.**  PRs that do not compile will not be accepted.
4. **Large changes require discussion.**  If you're doing a large, game-changing modification, or a new layout for something, discussion with the community is required as of 26/6/2014.  Map and sprite changes require pictures of before and after.  **MAINTAINERS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO THIS.  GET YOUR ASS IN IRC.**

It is also suggested that you hop into irc.rizon.net #vgstation to discuss your changes, or if you need help.
