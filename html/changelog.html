				<li class="rscadd">The Squash reagent/drug is a double edged performance enhancer that boosts your tackling abilities. If consumed by non dwarves, they&#39;ll suffer brute damage for 30s before turning into a dwarf (as long as Squash is still in their system). If they run out of squash, the recoil from growing back to normal size will break every bone in their body, unless their bones were reinforced with Degencalcium beforehand.</li>

It does make you tweak out at times, though. Made by mixing 1 part Albuterol, 3 parts Hydrogen, 1 part Chlorine and 5u Carbon (catalyst), then heating to 200°C, which makes 2 parts meth.</li>

				<li class="experiment">The Cult Eclipse Update is here!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cultists have a new UI Panel that enables easier tracking of the cult&#39;s members, their objectives, and lots of other important information.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">As cultists perform occult activities and complete objectives, they generate devotion which both grants them Tattoos imbued with new powers, but also quickens the arrival of the new Eclipse event.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">During the Eclipse, all lights aboard the station are dimmed, highly reducing visibility. The cult can use the new (very old in fact) Tear Reality rune during the eclipse to start a ritual that can let them end the round. If the Eclipse ends without the ritual being attempted, the crew will be safe from Nar-Sie for this round.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If the cult attempts to raise Nar-Sie, they will have to defend a Blood Stone for a certain amount of time, and from that point onward all cultists will have a visible halo betraying their appearance to the crew. If the Blood Stone is destroyed, the ritual will end, and the cult will receive various handicaps, such has the halo remaining visible, and the cultist cap falling to zero.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Scoreboard now lists cultists in order of how much devotion they generated. The cult now &#34;wins&#34; or &#34;loses&#34; following various conditions, each with a different message on the scoreboard. A cult that couldn&#39;t raise Nar-Sie can still get a victory by having some of its members escape alive and free aboard the shuttle.</li>
