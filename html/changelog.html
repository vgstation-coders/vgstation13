				<li class="rscadd">Most of the Blob Overmind notifications added in the last update now have a (JUMP) button, so for example you can immediately find which of your blob nodes just got destroyed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blob Overminds have a new verb called "Call Overminds", which sends a notification to all the other overminds, along with a button allowing them to jump to you.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blob Overminds that spawn in a blob core created by an Overmind are now called Blob Cerebrate. So they can easily tell which one of them was the original one (and the only one who can place new cores)</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Blobs now emit a cloud of purple smoke over whatever they are affecting. So now you get a clear visual feedback when someone gets attacked by them, or they destroy something (wall or item).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Huge revamp of the blob's visuals. Blobs now support two kind of looks. classic ones (made from 32x32 dmi) and new ones (made from 64x64 dmi)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new looks feature added overlays, animations, such as connections between the blobs, or various feedback animations (normal blob transmitting a pulse, factory producing a mob, resource producing a point, etc)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new looks also features a damage overlay, letting you know approximately how much health the blob part has. In the classic look, only the normal blobs have a damaged sprite.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">When a blob gets pulsed, it will now hurt any mob standing on their tile. Telescience teleporting you right next to the core so you can destroy it without any danger is no longer a viable strategy, unless you have a really good armor, a really powerful gun, and even then it will require some testing.</li>

				<li class="experiment">SUMMARY</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Heat transfer Rehaul</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hypothermia added</li>
				<li class="rscadd">changes to things that cause cold damage</li>
				<li class="rscadd">space blankets</li>
				<li class="rscadd">ghetto space suits with space blankets</li>
				<li class="rscadd">thermal homeostasis regulator that when emagged becomes the mancrowave</li>
				<li class="tweak">changes to cryo</li>
				<li class="experiment">INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HEAT TRANSFER</li>
				<li class="tweak">removes useless variables heat_protection & cold_protection as these were in 99% of circumstances the exact same as body_parts_covered</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added a new variable, heat_conductivity to all items, determining how fast they conduct heat away from you</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added new procs to humans, sweat() & burn_calories() - Now whenever you use up nutriment, you generate heat, but can also expend nutriment to decrease heat.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">refactored how heat transfer away from humans worked ( see above)</li>
				<li class="experiment">INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HYPOTHERMIA</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added Mild Hypothermia (between 32 and 35C) - this results in shivering, minor slowdown and messages informing the player that they are cold.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added Moderate hypothermia (between 28 and 32C) - Shivering stops, slowdown increases, may slur/stutter words, chance of dropping items in hand and collapsing temporarily, as well as a 25% chance of forgetting how to use machines like when braindamaged</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added severe hypothermia (24 to 28C), shivering stops, player is unconcious, pulse decreases to 30BPM and has a 25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, which decreases over time as you are still breathing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added profound hypothermia (less than 24C), pulse stops, player has a 25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, does not decrease over time as they are not breathing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">CHANGES THINGS WHICH CAUSE COLD DAMAGE, including but not limited to coldingtons, cryokinesis, showers, goliaths, temperature gun, and chemicals which chill people. Foam fire extinguishers are not affected.</li>
				<li class="experiment">THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR</li>
				<li class="experiment">Please use this when taking someone out of cryo</li>
				<li class="tweak">When a person is dragged in, it will automatically begin stabilising, there is no need for more buttons to be pressed</li>
				<li class="tweak">Takes 5 seconds to heat/cool someone to 37C, which works out as quicker than shaking someone up.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Can be emagged to allow for three extra settings - this process is extremely visible, and there is a different sprite for when an emagged function is used</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Can reenable security features to quickly unemag the device and Can bring the device to an emergency stop.</li>
				<li class="experiment">CHANGES TO CRYO</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cryo now releases someone at 23C instead of -12C (or 25C if they manually eject)</li>
				<li class="experiment">PLEASE USE THE THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR AFTER TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF CRYO</li>
				<li class="tweak">Manual eject time brought down from 2 minutes to 30 seconds to make it time-neutral</li>
				<li class="tweak">This means that, as the person is ejected below profound hypothermia, they will not breathe until they heat up a wee bit further. This is a positive change, as vox & plasmamen will no longer die from toxin damage/fire immediately after leaving cryo.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">People inside a cryo cell do not suffer from hypothermia until leaving.</li>
