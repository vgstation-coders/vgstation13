				<li class="tweak">Substantially increased the chance for Wizarditis to spawn wizard clothing after the symptom has activated 60 times.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Also increased the chance for Wizarditis to cause spell casting from 3 percent per activation to 20 percent.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Magnitis has been buffed quite a lot from the near-invisible symptom it was until now. The Symptom no longer has to pass two probability checks to activate instead of one. Its area of effect has also been increased by 1 tile for each three levels of intensity (which increases after the first 10 and 20 activations, to 3 tiles, to 6 tiles, to 9 tiles.)</li>
				<li class="experiment">A satellite has been observed drifting through Nanotrasen space which is believed to be the testing grounds of a new experimental type of AME. Whatever tests were done there appear to have stopped and the satellite was evacuated in a hurry. The satellite itself was deemed too unsafe to properly decommission so it is still drifting through space to this day. Regardless, do not go near it. Do not board it. And by all means Do Not try to resume the experiments that were happening there.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed NO_BLOOD human species still creating blood splatters when getting ZAS-slammed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The AME has gotten a bit of TLC, featuring new sounds, animations, a properly scaled UI that updates when interacted with, and the packaged reactor sections have gotten a new sprite and more importantly update the surrounding shield parts immediately after being deployed. The cores also emit a tiny bit of light when the AME is active. Finally the jars themselves now have in-hand icons, and feature a gauge on their side that displays how much fuel they have.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed blob meteors sometimes spawning adjacent duplicate blobs.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Removed duplicate cables under Roidstation Engineering&#39;s SMES</li>
				<li class="tweak">Suiciding while holding one of the cyanide pills that Nuke Ops spawn with now instantly deals you all the damage that it would have done to you over time. That&#39;s 500 toxloss and 500 oxyloss, so basically an instant death without having to suicide AND succumb.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes examining people wearing accessories indicating &#34;it has nothing&#34; when there are in fact accessories</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added wristwatches to the game, a new uniform accessory. Their hands move in real time on their sprite, and you can click it to get the current station time down to the second. Can be purchased from the merch computer at the Cargo Lobby.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">They can also extremely rarely be found from maintenance loot spawners, and tourists coming out of Ancient Cryopods have one equipped as a reference to the old long-time layering glitch that caused their right arm to appear to wear a red strap.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Captains spawn with a unique golden wristwatch. Although there is a small chance of getting another one from the Vault&#39;s safe.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There is also a sleek black variant that can be rarely found from maint spawners. Nuclear Operatives spawn equipped with those, as time is of the essence in their field.</li>

There will be at least one on each map, until then you can build them from R&amp;D. You can also Alt Click the booth to select one of several backgrounds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">ID Photo are a new subtype of photos. Just like regular photos you can write on them, use them on newscasters, but more importantly, when using them on a Security or Medical Records computer open on a given entry, you can scan the photo on the computer to update the entry&#39;s photo. Until now, new records created at a Security Computer were damned to never have any picture, this changes at last!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added scissors. They&#39;re basically just wirecutters with a different sprite. You can print them at an autolathe from the Misc Tools category. You can use them (or any type of wirecutter) on an ID photo to split it into 4 regular photos. Those individual photos CANNOT be used to update records.</li>

This applies to monkeys as well since they always attack by biting, but not to mice whose teeth aren&#39;t quite big enough.</li>
