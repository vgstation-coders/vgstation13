				<li class="rscadd">Added wristwatches to the game, a new uniform accessory. Their hands move in real time on their sprite, and you can click it to get the current station time down to the second. Can be purchased from the merch computer at the Cargo Lobby.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">They can also extremely rarely be found from maintenance loot spawners, and tourists coming out of Ancient Cryopods have one equipped as a reference to the old long-time layering glitch that caused their right arm to appear to wear a red strap.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Captains spawn with a unique golden wristwatch. Although there is a small chance of getting another one from the Vault&#39;s safe.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There is also a sleek black variant that can be rarely found from maint spawners. Nuclear Operatives spawn equipped with those, as time is of the essence in their field.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Finally a pocket watch variant can be dug up frome house/dwellings digsites on the asteroid. Let your local xenoarchaeologist know if you&#39;re interested in getting one.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Special thanks to terrel for providing the gold, black, and pocket watch sprites.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new machine, the Photo Booth. Can be entered by just walking inside from the front, clicking it while inside will buckle you in there for a few seconds, then after a few seconds an ID photo will pop out of the machine. There will be at least one on each map, until then you can build them from R&amp;D. You can also Alt Click the booth to select one of several backgrounds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">ID Photo are a new subtype of photos. Just like regular photos you can write on them, use them on newscasters, but more importantly, when using them on a Security or Medical Records computer open on a given entry, you can scan the photo on the computer to update the entry&#39;s photo. Until now, new records created at a Security Computer were damned to never have any picture, this changes at last!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added scissors. They&#39;re basically just wirecutters with a different sprite. You can print them at an autolathe from the Misc Tools category. You can use them (or any type of wirecutter) on an ID photo to split it into 4 regular photos. Those individual photos CANNOT be used to update records.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the same player being picked several times at once to be a wizard during Civil War of Casters, and ending up with more Spell Books at their disposal while other players get cucked out of their antag roll.</li>

This applies to monkeys as well since they always attack by biting, but not to mice whose teeth aren&#39;t quite big enough.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the right panel being much smaller than normal (hopefully)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer write in blood as a ghost if the source blood disappeared before you finished writing your message.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer write in blood if there is no blood left on your hands or glove by the time you finish writing your message.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Ghosts can now only write in blood up to a certain amount of tiles from the original blood source (before they could daisy-chain messages ad nauseam). The max distance depends of the original source&#39;s amount of blood. A drip will only have a radius of 1. Splatters a radius of 2. Gibs a radius of 5. (Same distance as footprints)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Projectiles now have a 75 percent chance of hitting mobs in cages, as long as the cover is up.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Just like artificers can click floors up to 3 tiles away to convert them into cult floors, they can now click space tiles to conjure floors over them. As when done by clicking the spell button, conjuring a tile instead of converting one leads to a longer cooldown.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed mapped alien embryos not spawning a dead alien larva. Expect to find a few dead larvas hidden on some maps.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All playable mobs now have standardized damage overlays which should help players controlling simple_animals noticing when they&#39;re taking damage.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the brute and oxy damage overlays going away for a second then coming back when dying. Those overlays also now come back instantly when re-entering a corpse.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Patched an exploit that allowed players to unload ore boxes using the pop-up window from any distance away or even adjacent but otherwise incapacitated, which apparently allowed a few people to mess with our shaft miner friends.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Also fixed ore unloading machines causing all ore boxes in their area to dump everything every second, instead of only those in front of them.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Dynamic ruleset picking had its pseudo-RNG tweaked to now consider not just the previous round, but all 3 previous rounds, decreasing the odds of a ruleset being picked again in a short timespan. The odds are reduced more if the round was more recent, and if it fired several times in the previous three rounds the odd reductions will stack up. This should help prevent having the same ruleset firing several times in a short timespan.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Although note that rulesets that fire when the round was already about to end will NOT affect future rounds&#39; ruleset weights.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Syndicate Traitors, both roundstart, latejoin, and midround, are also always exempt from this weight reduction.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Primetime rulesets now have lowered threat requirement, which should allow them to actually fire if the pop allows it but the Threat is average. Basically this means that Blob Tuesdays can finally be a thing. Also note that this doesn&#39;t affect low pop (if the threat requirement is 90, it will remain 90 in most cases)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The holomap on from the PDA Station Holomap app now properly updates when moving aboard a vehicle.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">The Biohazard Alert level during a viral infection event or viral outbreak event is now proportional to the actual combined danger of the disease&#39;s effects. It can be as low as 1, and all the way to 8 if the combined danger is 15 or 16 which are the highest possible currently (disregarding adminbus). 9 as always is reserved for Blob.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed humans no longer having bloody hands unless they&#39;re wearing gloves.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed surgery steps that should bloody your hands no longer doing so.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Write in Blood verb has been reworked. Both ghosts and humans now have it at all time under the Ghost and IC tab respectively. When using it you will attempt to write on your tile. Ghosts need to be either visible, or the cult must have reached the bloodstone phase. They will look for a blood splatter or footprint in an adjacent tile, if there are several they will get the option of which one to use, along with the source&#39;s color hex code. Humans however need blood on their hands or gloves and will use that one. You can preview your message before confirming like when using a crayon. There can be only one doodle per tile, and it carries DNA and color from the source blood. Also unlike the old bloody doodles, those are maptext&#39;d, and can be read without being examined.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Punching someone on a limb that is currently bleeding will splash their blood on your hands.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed dead mice still being able to nibble</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased the layer at which remains appear. They appear now above tables but still below objects. As such they are no longer hidden by things like vents, scrubbers and pipe.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">When hitting someone with a weapon, should you miss the intended target limb and hit another limb, the chat will now correctly report which limb has been hit.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Bomberman Spawns no longer invisible to ghosts who had darkness toggled off</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Bomberman Arenas no longer have their name in the corner set up incorrectly and showing up as literally just &#34;name&#34;</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Clothing in Bomerman Arenas  no longer remain on the ground after a round.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reworked rag smothering to fix a few bugs. The new implementation requires you to target the rag at their mouth with a 1 second delay (a visible warning and SFX play as soon as an attempt is made). Species that do not breath cannot be smothered. People wearing smoke-blocking masks such as gas masks, internals, clown masks, surgical masks or cigarettes (if they&#39;re lit) cannot be smothered either. Upon success, all reagents inside the rag will be transferred inside the target (up to 5u).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You no longer try to wipe down people that you are currently smothering or bandaging with a rag.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You no longer try to wipe down the Sink when you fill up your rag.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cultists now stop dancing while incapacitated, or when muted by holy water. This includes constructs when they are purged by a null rod.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Cultists with the Chameleon gene no longer remain invisible while dancing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cultists can now DANCE wherever using say &#34;*cultdance&#34;. They will dance around the tile in front of them, so for the best looks do it in an open area. If other cultists uses the emote while adjacent to the first cultist&#39;s &#34;dance center&#34;, they will join up and dance in sync. Up to 4 cultists may dance together without bumping into each other (as unlike the sacrifice/bloodstone dance, this one doesn&#39;t use forceMove)</li>
				<li class="tweak">You now need to be on help intent to reveal runes using a null rod. This means that you no longer get extra delay added to your attacks when using one to fight and missing by clicking the floor.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed mindless Wraiths appearing if you removed an amorphous mask that turns you into a Wraith when reaching the end of an Ethereal Jaunt.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Added a new Traitor Botanist uplink item, the Bee-Nade, which has been reworked to in fact spawn hornets that will immediately seek a target when they spawn. They also ignore the one who primed the spawner grenade, just like viscerators do. Cost 16 (Discount 8)</li>
				<li class="experiment">The Hornet Queen Packet traitor item has been replaced with a Deployable Wild Hornet Hive. Place it, throw it, drop it, but be careful as it cannot be picked up again once deployed. Those behave exactly like those from random events, except they spawn with less hornets inside, giving you a few seconds to get away before they start coming out. Cost 10 (Discount 5)</li>
				<li class="experiment">The swarm coming out of a Bee Briefcase now performs an attack as soon as it comes out of the briefcase, greatly increasing its lethal power. The TC cost has been slightly adjusted to match its increased lethality. Cost 12 (Discout 6)</li>
				<li class="experiment">Bees and the likes now attack AFTER moving instead of before. This effectively increases their attack range, and so their dangerousness.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bees that spawn from vermin infestations and hornets of all kind now immediately become angry again after their calmed status has expired instead of going back to their hive or to roaming.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bee and Hornet gatling guns bullets no longer deal direct damage, instead they immediately cause the spawned bug to attack once on impact. Said attack is also guaranteed to pierce bio or impermeable armors.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a chillbug gatling gun. It doesn&#39;t deal damage of course but will inject 1u chillwax into players hit by the projectile.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added both the hornetgun and chillgun to Summon Guns.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Bees and the likes can no longer attack through one-sided windows and windoors.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed not being able to stomp snails when on harm intent.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer convert the same mob several times (should they refuse and get restrained) to get additional progression on the Conversion objective.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Converting a mindless monkey (whether still monkey or human) will sacrifice them, leaving behind a coffer with a skull</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Space Heaters and Cult Forges can no longer heat up a room that&#39;s in a vacuum, causing mobs to take damage even though there is no molecules with which to exchange temperature.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed soul blades being offset both in the inventory and on the player when stored in the suit slot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All condiment bottles can have their content spilled over the floor if they are set to transfer 10 or more units. The amount spilled depends of the transferable amount set.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Spilling 10 or more units of black pepper over the floor will create a cleanable mess.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Tweaked the icons for salt piles and pepper mills.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Holy Salts, a new reagent that can be easily produced by putting normal table salt in presence of a 5u catalyst of holy water. Just like salt, it will create cleanable piles when 10u of it are spilled over the floor.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When salt piles are spawned, they now emit particles when they detect the presence of cult runes (even if concealed), talismans, tomes, and most other cult paraphernelia. After a set amount of time, the runes will be destroyed, the talismans and tomes will burn, and the other objects will break and melt away. The delay is 5 minutes for regular table salt, and 20 seconds for holy salts and starts when the pile is created.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When a Path Entrance rune or a talisman attuned to a Path Exit rune is destroyed by a salt pile, a blood jaunt visible for a short duration will zoom toward the corresponding exit, giving the crew a hint as to the location of the Path Exit, and potentially a cult base. The jaunt will make a distinctive noise once it reaches the exit, letting any cultist near it at the time know that their base might be compromised.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a couple more country flag-bearing mugs. Mug boxes such as those included in Cafe Equipment supply crates now include a random one each.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Flag Mugs finally appear filled with liquid when some has been poured in them.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Re-did the in-hand icons for mugs, and added some for all flag mugs. Mugs that contain a liquid that has a unique mug sprite no longer appear invisible in-hand, and instead use the default mug sprite.</li>

			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">The Astral Journey cult rune has been completely reworked.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Using the rune no longer sends the user into sleep, allowing them to move as soon as they interrupt the ritual.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Improved the sprite generation of the cultified ghosts in general. The uniform and suit are now featured and partially truncated so only the upper body is visible.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Astral projections can now toggle (with a 5 sec cooldown) between a tangible and an intangible state.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">While intangible (the default) astral projections can move around like ghosts as usual, see in the dark, and now passively have the Seer rune&#39;s convertibility HUD, allowing cultists to plan for potential converts to abduct from the safety of their base. But most importantly, when speaking while intangible the player will speak directly into cult chat, giving them the ability to help coordinate their peers with unprecedented efficiency.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">While tangible however, the projection becomes visible and looks just like the user. Even tricking examination and sechuds (medhuds however will not appear over their heads). They are fairly limited still when it comes to physical interactions, they can bump into doors and casually talk with people, but they are completely unable to pick up any item, press any button or pull any object. Furthermore they will get dispelled should they take the slightest amount of damage. Their role is to either allow the cult to safely converse with the crew after their identity has been exposed, or to cause mischief. And if nothing else, to spook the crew.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">In either state, the projection will be dispelled should you move it to another Z-Level, or should your body be moved away from the rune (or from the tile if it was triggered from a talisman). If your body dies while still on top of the rune, your shade will materialize at the current location of your astral projection.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">To complement those changes, cult hoods now have a button that lets cultists hide their face and voice, potentially giving them the ability to perform highly visible deeds without necessarily compromising their identity (as long as they don&#39;t forget to remove their ID).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Engineering hard hats now have their sprite properly update on the player when toggling their light bulb.</li>
