			<h2 class="date">2023.06.27</h2>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Regular blob tiles once again (after 7 years) visibly brighten when a pulse passes through them. Pulses are emitted by Cores, Nodes, and Overminds. So if you see some nearby blob blinking brightly despite no Node being nearby, that means the Overmind currently has their attention on you. Hopefully it shouldn&#39;t cause more CPU usage this time.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blob Cores and Nodes now emit light, whose color depends upon which skin has been selected</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Blob Core and Node pulse animations once again render above darkness, like they were meant to.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Blob turning shuttle tiles black when expanding over them.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some roundstart Blob ruleset initialization issue that could lead to the blob getting extra antag roles if multiple roundstart rulesets fire together.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some animations (such as the cult teleport animations) ending about a second earlier than they should.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Parallax wraparound has finally been fixed, you will no longer leave stars behind forever if you keep moving in one direction in space.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">DorainGrey updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds a radio for Nukies, where they can request reinforcement and get extra TC in exchange for waiting 10 minutes during the ensuing bluespace distortion.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Kurfursten updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">There is now an art vendor. Coming soon to a library near you.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The librarian can now request the removal of a book from the library database with a button. Do your civic duty and delete the garbage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Librarians and admins can now preview a book in the database without ordering it.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Books should not briefly flash a different cover when first ordered from the checkout computer.</li>
			</ul>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">jellyveggie2 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Pressure valves can now also compare temperature, and have been renamed to conditional valves.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Conditional valves can now also compare the control pipe against the input pipes&#39; gases, rather than just a fixed value.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Conditional valves can now also forego the side input entirely, using either of the two other pipes as control. This might help make some designs neater and more compact.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Conditional valves can no longer be controlled via AAC, beyond simple on/off commands.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">nervere updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Deadchat is now notified when and where a player dies, with an option to jump to that player&#39;s location.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Non-existent bodies can once again be cloned, assuming you got yourself a DNA scan beforehand.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Slimepeople that are dusted no longer generate slime puddles.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Slimepeople that are gibbed are now cloneable, provided you have their slime puddle.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">smonkeM updated:</h3>

			<h3 class="author">Eneocho updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Getmore and Discount Dan&#39;s have started stocking their machines with mint candy. Getmore sells a pack for 30 credits, while Discount Dan&#39;s sells them for a coin, as it is one of the rare non toxic items they sell, and that cuts into profits. The old vendortron somehow got access to a homemade brand of mints.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mint Essence, only available inside mint candy, it is the unrefined version of Mint Toxin, being perfectly safe to consume.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mint Toxin and Mint Essence will keep you minty fresh. This helps with heat (like drinking iced coffee) and gives you an ever so slight boost to sports performance (same level as sugar).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Being minty fresh and drinking ice water might cause dental pain. Drinking coffee immediately afterwards will cause some less than desirable effects to your dental health.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes some icon issues with the icons calling for a pill bottle label.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Made the NT icon for the NT mints blue, instead of green.</li>

				<li class="rscdel">Non-Time Agents can&#39;t use the jump charge and timeline eraser anymore.</li>
				<li class="tweak">In case it is destroyed, the Time Agent&#39;s jump charge will respawn in a random location on the station. It will not respawn if the Time Agent uses it to teleport away via a time anomaly.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Generally cleaned up Time Agents, their equipment should now feel more straightforward and responsive to use.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Time Agent&#39;s timeline eraser now has a cooldown of 10 seconds after a successful erasure, and only takes 5 seconds to delete an object rather than 10. Living beings still take 10 seconds. It will also make the target drop everything after being erased, instead of the target&#39;s equipment being erased alongside them.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed the chronocapture objective of finding an AI Long-Range Upload Console Circuitboard to just finding the console itself. The former typically required deconstructing the console in the AI&#39;s Upload chamber, but this will allow Time Agents to just directly photograph the console itself.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Welding a wall down should no longer do double damage to your eyes.</li>
