				<li class="rscadd">All Singlo machinery which previously was not bolted down now properly is so that its less of a pain in the ass to set up</li>
				<li class="rscadd">bagel SME chamber took a few pointers from roidstation. SME chamber should be easily altered to current SME meta since doing stuff yourself is too hard for some people. tl;dr: SME chamber improved</li>
				<li class="tweak">Chapel reduced in size by request. Hallway altered to fit this change.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The AI chamber is now "normal" with the cooled nitrogen removed. This was deemed too zany by many. Shame.</li>

				<li class="tweak">While I was in there, theres now exactly six sets of mining gear and prisoner suits available for gulag prisoners. There was originally between 3 and six of the different gear items so now it should be balanced as all things should be.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Doubled the starting power for SMES. This should give you enough time to get power running before the power outages.</li>
				<li class="experiment">The following applies to bagelstation</li>
				<li class="experiment">Altered the powernet around engineering again, yellow wires take power from power sources to the SMES. SMES takes power to the station through red wires. This should make using the portable SMES easier to use. There are already ports for porta-SMES for each major department.</li>
