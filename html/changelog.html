				<li class="tweak">The traitor mime hand-gun&#39;s bullets no longer cause shrapnel to appear out of thin air.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Ore Unloader has had both its appearance and mechanics slightly refreshed. It now plays an animation when it forces an ore box to dump its content and another one when grabbing items. The new sprite was designed to fit along nicely with conveyor belts, and kept the original machine&#39;s color scheme.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Ore Unloaders not emptying ore boxes.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Pianos, Space Minimoog and Xylophones that come out of the random instrument or big band instrument collection supply packs are no longer anchored and can be immediately pulled around.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Photography Camera had their underlying mechanics thoroughly reworked, which should have fixed most bugs related to them, including some objects being invisible, having the wrong orientation, mannequins not wearing clothes on pictures, etc...</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed clothing being offset on cyber mannequins.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Mice and other no-damage animals clicking inflatable shelter will now nuzzle them instead of attacking them in vain.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the Pitbulls spell icon appearing quite strangely on the round end scoreboard.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Abandoned mining crates now have a dusty look.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Conveyors belts no longer send items through one-direction windows and obstacles if there&#39;s a receiving machine such as a disposal chute on the other side.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When failing a surgery step because you were operating on a table, or a regular roller bed, you will now trigger an actual surgery step failure instead of attacking the patient with your tool.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Eneocho updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Irradiated Beans, Re-Fried Beans, Mutated Beans, Off-Color Cheese, Greenish Ramen Noodles, Glowing Ramen Noodles, Deep Fried Ramen Noodles, Horse Meat and Beff now have a nutrition value.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Irradiated Beans, Greenish Ramen Noodles and Glowing Ramen Noodles have a chance to irradiate when metabolizing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Toxic Waste, Mutated Beans and Greenish Ramen Noodles have a chance to poison when metabolizing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Moon Rocks has a chance to cause brute damage (Because it hates the human skeleton) when metabolizing.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Jackreturnswithaveangenace updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added a suit storage unit for Trauma Team rigsuits as well as a pair of matching magboots, so adminbus and mappers can have some more versatility with apogee&#39;s cool designs.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">SonixApache updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">agent cards can now be disguised as cargo cards</li>
				<li class="bugfix">mapped corpses now have the correct ID card icons</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">TGFH updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">X, Y, Z coordinates added to the ingame comms console logs</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2021.06.17</h2>
			<h3 class="author">robintime updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">adds a special box to spawn equipment on dorfstation</li>
				<li class="rscadd">adds an unobtainable, nonreactive version of medcores called hardcores</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2021.06.16</h2>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Delivery Chutes not activating if items where inserted via conveyor belts.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dorfstation now features a defective cloning pod among the other ancient cryogenic pods. Ghosts of players who died can click it at least 10 minutes after they died to respawn as if they came out of a cloning pod. However this means respawning with clone and brain damage, and a guaranteed genetic disability. Therefore you can decide for yourself whether to wait and preserve your identity, or respawn with a new identity from an ancient cryo pod. Alternatively, wait for the crew to set up medbay with a proper cloning pod.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added new mannequin types! Using either a marble (obtainable from cargo) or wooden (craftable) block, you can now sculpt a human woman, or a corgi. Said corgi mannequins can wear items just like real corgis do.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Spessmen have gotten better at sculpting mannequins, and can now sculpt their hair and beards.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mannequins mobs, such as those that can be found on the drone ship, or created by wizards using a staff of animation on a mannequin, are now able to fire the guns in their hands, and benefit from the armor they are wearing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Flesh to Stone now turns humans, vox, monkeys and corgi into marble mannequins instead of statues. This means that items can be attached on them or removed, but also that when hit by a bolt of animation, they will fight using the items in their hands and benefit from the armor that they are wearing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Apetrine no longer kills or makes unclonable the mobs trapped in a statue if said statue was mostly undamaged (if the mob&#39;s HP were above 50 when they got trapped) although they will still take a fair bit of damage and might die shortly after if not given medical care.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">ShiftyRail updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">You can now place mounted frames on top of full-tile windows or directional windows oriented in a way to support the light frame.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2021.06.15</h2>
			<h3 class="author">DamianX updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Extended can no longer fire with fewer than 30 players.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Cyborgs still being able to roll Challenger, again.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2021.06.14</h2>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Removed the random wall vent hidden under a sign at Packedstation&#39;s Chemistry lab.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">boy2mantwicethefam updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug where player-controlled zombies could attack while double dead (given that zombies are already dead and when you shoot one enough it becomes double-dead, although this time two negatives don&#39;t turn into a positive)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new spell for the ancient spellbook, Card Trick! Guess what someone&#39;s card is and their inventory will completely fill up with the copies of the card!</li>
				<li class="bugfix">&#34;A card&#34; not &#34;card&#34; description for playing cards.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2021.06.12</h2>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the right panel being much smaller than normal (hopefully)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer write in blood as a ghost if the source blood disappeared before you finished writing your message.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer write in blood if there is no blood left on your hands or glove by the time you finish writing your message.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Ghosts can now only write in blood up to a certain amount of tiles from the original blood source (before they could daisy-chain messages ad nauseam). The max distance depends of the original source&#39;s amount of blood. A drip will only have a radius of 1. Splatters a radius of 2. Gibs a radius of 5. (Same distance as footprints)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Projectiles now have a 75 percent chance of hitting mobs in cages, as long as the cover is up.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Just like artificers can click floors up to 3 tiles away to convert them into cult floors, they can now click space tiles to conjure floors over them. As when done by clicking the spell button, conjuring a tile instead of converting one leads to a longer cooldown.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed mapped alien embryos not spawning a dead alien larva. Expect to find a few dead larvas hidden on some maps.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All playable mobs now have standardized damage overlays which should help players controlling simple_animals noticing when they&#39;re taking damage.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the brute and oxy damage overlays going away for a second then coming back when dying. Those overlays also now come back instantly when re-entering a corpse.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Patched an exploit that allowed players to unload ore boxes using the pop-up window from any distance away or even adjacent but otherwise incapacitated, which apparently allowed a few people to mess with our shaft miner friends.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Also fixed ore unloading machines causing all ore boxes in their area to dump everything every second, instead of only those in front of them.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Dynamic ruleset picking had its pseudo-RNG tweaked to now consider not just the previous round, but all 3 previous rounds, decreasing the odds of a ruleset being picked again in a short timespan. The odds are reduced more if the round was more recent, and if it fired several times in the previous three rounds the odd reductions will stack up. This should help prevent having the same ruleset firing several times in a short timespan.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Although note that rulesets that fire when the round was already about to end will NOT affect future rounds&#39; ruleset weights.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Syndicate Traitors, both roundstart, latejoin, and midround, are also always exempt from this weight reduction.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Primetime rulesets now have lowered threat requirement, which should allow them to actually fire if the pop allows it but the Threat is average. Basically this means that Blob Tuesdays can finally be a thing. Also note that this doesn&#39;t affect low pop (if the threat requirement is 90, it will remain 90 in most cases)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The holomap on from the PDA Station Holomap app now properly updates when moving aboard a vehicle.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The round end scoreboard now indicates which potions were bought by a wizard.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed scoreboard icons either missing or being wrong.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Eneocho updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Makes the mouser fit inside the handgun holster.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Jackreturnswithaveangenace updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Fixed an exploitable thing and added dorf mommi spawners to dorf.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">kane-f updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Compressed matter implants now only store the activation emote in the memory of the implanter instead of the implanted, as with other traitor implants.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">RCDs can no longer be used on windows to remove mysterious invulnerable grilles.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2021.06.11</h2>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">The scoreboard of the previous round can now be checked at any point by clicking the Last Round Information button that is now always available in the top right (until the current round ends)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Jackreturnswithaveangenace updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds a fully dysfunctional station for dorfmode events. Room for both chilling out in caves and building a functioning station. Includes a derelict ship mapped by BurntDevil.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2021.06.09</h2>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added the white chicken suit I sprited back in 2015 and forgot to actually PR all this time. A single costume can be obtained from the AutoDrobe after inserting a coin.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Improved the chicken suit and head in-hand icons.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Humans have a few new emotes. ok/okay makes an OK sign, thumbup/thumbsup makes a thumbs up, thumbdown/thumbsdown makes a thumbs down, and peace makes a peace sign.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added hand count requirements for those emotes. Having your hands broken or amputated will make you unable to perform them.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">boy2mantwicethefam updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">On the most foolish of days of the year, janitors lose their income, toiling for no monetary compensation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2021.06.08</h2>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug that caused challengers to spawn with no objectives if their target was the Trader.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When cloned you now keep the default language you had when you were scanned.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2021.06.07</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Apogee-dev updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Makes replicator mommi&#39;s emagged eyes red</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Mature Space Vines (kudzu) will now properly spread when an adjacent door opens or an adjacent wall is dismantled.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Biomass spreading through one-directional windows and firelocks.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a very rare bug (actually I&#39;ve calculated that it had a 4.5 percent chance of occurring which isn&#39;t THAT rare) where the Safe&#39;s tumblers were set in a way that prevented players from ever cracking the Safe open. But this time for real. No really, I&#39;ve tested it with extreme values and all that.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the Atmospheric Alert Computer appearing to be invisible when broken.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2021.06.06</h2>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Egun beams now have their alpha reduced proportionally to their damage when they get dispersed by windows.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">beams no longer lag when firing through a large corridor or into space.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed full-tile windows not reducing beam damage. It now does it with the same efficiency as a single directional window.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Firing beams straight through a tile featuring directional windows will no longer reduce its damage if the window isn&#39;t oriented toward (or away) from the source of the beam (which means that in most cases, if the beam crosses a tile with a window without intersecting with it, it shouldn&#39;t lose some of its damage)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed players losing space parallax upon turning into Shades.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed beams not going through windows facing the other way.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed beams dealing 0 damage never disappearing.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2021.06.05</h2>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed reagent splashing from beakers.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2021.06.04</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Allspice updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Re-add NATO alphabet language to deathsquaddies.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Apogee-dev updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Dynamic now checks alt titles in addition to job titles for protection &amp; restriction from antag roles</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Medic armor vest, made by using a green crayon on a sec vest. Use bleach to return to original skin.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Trauma Team hardsuit, currently only available by bus</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Organ Failure random events now have their own custom command alert instead of using a Biohazard Alert of random level (also more appropriate as there is no outbreak to contain here).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Biohazard Alert level during a viral infection event or viral outbreak event is now proportional to the actual combined danger of the disease&#39;s effects. It can be as low as 1, and all the way to 8 if the combined danger is 15 or 16 which are the highest possible currently (disregarding adminbus). 9 as always is reserved for Blob.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the admin buttons to &#34;Toggle a Lights Out&#34; or a &#34;Prison Break&#34;  not using the correct events.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the admin option to create a new disease using an already existing pathogen displaying IDs only instead of the disease&#39;s full name.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Admin-made pathogen not having the ID that was set by its creator.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the admin &#34;Trigger a Virus Outbreak&#34; button not working.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Admins can now trigger a custom outbreak event that will spread a previously prepared pathogen among the crew, and display the usual alert after some time as passed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Non-red blood in a drinking glass will now have a fake name slightly more believable than Tomato Juice.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a couple new items to the Safe loot table.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed emitter goggles not working on mannequins</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed glasses mapped onto mannequins not being properly equipped when the map loads</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed items removed by monkeys from their backpack having a full-tile hitbox.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed humans no longer having bloody hands unless they&#39;re wearing gloves.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed surgery steps that should bloody your hands no longer doing so.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Write in Blood verb has been reworked. Both ghosts and humans now have it at all time under the Ghost and IC tab respectively. When using it you will attempt to write on your tile. Ghosts need to be either visible, or the cult must have reached the bloodstone phase. They will look for a blood splatter or footprint in an adjacent tile, if there are several they will get the option of which one to use, along with the source&#39;s color hex code. Humans however need blood on their hands or gloves and will use that one. You can preview your message before confirming like when using a crayon. There can be only one doodle per tile, and it carries DNA and color from the source blood. Also unlike the old bloody doodles, those are maptext&#39;d, and can be read without being examined.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Punching someone on a limb that is currently bleeding will splash their blood on your hands.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed dead mice still being able to nibble</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased the layer at which remains appear. They appear now above tables but still below objects. As such they are no longer hidden by things like vents, scrubbers and pipe.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">When hitting someone with a weapon, should you miss the intended target limb and hit another limb, the chat will now correctly report which limb has been hit.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Bomberman Spawns no longer invisible to ghosts who had darkness toggled off</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Bomberman Arenas no longer have their name in the corner set up incorrectly and showing up as literally just &#34;name&#34;</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Clothing in Bomerman Arenas  no longer remain on the ground after a round.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reworked rag smothering to fix a few bugs. The new implementation requires you to target the rag at their mouth with a 1 second delay (a visible warning and SFX play as soon as an attempt is made). Species that do not breath cannot be smothered. People wearing smoke-blocking masks such as gas masks, internals, clown masks, surgical masks or cigarettes (if they&#39;re lit) cannot be smothered either. Upon success, all reagents inside the rag will be transferred inside the target (up to 5u).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You no longer try to wipe down people that you are currently smothering or bandaging with a rag.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You no longer try to wipe down the Sink when you fill up your rag.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cultists now stop dancing while incapacitated, or when muted by holy water. This includes constructs when they are purged by a null rod.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Cultists with the Chameleon gene no longer remain invisible while dancing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cultists can now DANCE wherever using say &#34;*cultdance&#34;. They will dance around the tile in front of them, so for the best looks do it in an open area. If other cultists uses the emote while adjacent to the first cultist&#39;s &#34;dance center&#34;, they will join up and dance in sync. Up to 4 cultists may dance together without bumping into each other (as unlike the sacrifice/bloodstone dance, this one doesn&#39;t use forceMove)</li>
				<li class="tweak">You now need to be on help intent to reveal runes using a null rod. This means that you no longer get extra delay added to your attacks when using one to fight and missing by clicking the floor.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed mindless Wraiths appearing if you removed an amorphous mask that turns you into a Wraith when reaching the end of an Ethereal Jaunt.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Added a new Traitor Botanist uplink item, the Bee-Nade, which has been reworked to in fact spawn hornets that will immediately seek a target when they spawn. They also ignore the one who primed the spawner grenade, just like viscerators do. Cost 16 (Discount 8)</li>
				<li class="experiment">The Hornet Queen Packet traitor item has been replaced with a Deployable Wild Hornet Hive. Place it, throw it, drop it, but be careful as it cannot be picked up again once deployed. Those behave exactly like those from random events, except they spawn with less hornets inside, giving you a few seconds to get away before they start coming out. Cost 10 (Discount 5)</li>
				<li class="experiment">The swarm coming out of a Bee Briefcase now performs an attack as soon as it comes out of the briefcase, greatly increasing its lethal power. The TC cost has been slightly adjusted to match its increased lethality. Cost 12 (Discout 6)</li>
				<li class="experiment">Bees and the likes now attack AFTER moving instead of before. This effectively increases their attack range, and so their dangerousness.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bees that spawn from vermin infestations and hornets of all kind now immediately become angry again after their calmed status has expired instead of going back to their hive or to roaming.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bee and Hornet gatling guns bullets no longer deal direct damage, instead they immediately cause the spawned bug to attack once on impact. Said attack is also guaranteed to pierce bio or impermeable armors.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a chillbug gatling gun. It doesn&#39;t deal damage of course but will inject 1u chillwax into players hit by the projectile.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added both the hornetgun and chillgun to Summon Guns.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Bees and the likes can no longer attack through one-sided windows and windoors.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed not being able to stomp snails when on harm intent.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer convert the same mob several times (should they refuse and get restrained) to get additional progression on the Conversion objective.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Converting a mindless monkey (whether still monkey or human) will sacrifice them, leaving behind a coffer with a skull</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Space Heaters and Cult Forges can no longer heat up a room that&#39;s in a vacuum, causing mobs to take damage even though there is no molecules with which to exchange temperature.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed soul blades being offset both in the inventory and on the player when stored in the suit slot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All condiment bottles can have their content spilled over the floor if they are set to transfer 10 or more units. The amount spilled depends of the transferable amount set.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Spilling 10 or more units of black pepper over the floor will create a cleanable mess.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Tweaked the icons for salt piles and pepper mills.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Holy Salts, a new reagent that can be easily produced by putting normal table salt in presence of a 5u catalyst of holy water. Just like salt, it will create cleanable piles when 10u of it are spilled over the floor.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When salt piles are spawned, they now emit particles when they detect the presence of cult runes (even if concealed), talismans, tomes, and most other cult paraphernelia. After a set amount of time, the runes will be destroyed, the talismans and tomes will burn, and the other objects will break and melt away. The delay is 5 minutes for regular table salt, and 20 seconds for holy salts and starts when the pile is created.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When a Path Entrance rune or a talisman attuned to a Path Exit rune is destroyed by a salt pile, a blood jaunt visible for a short duration will zoom toward the corresponding exit, giving the crew a hint as to the location of the Path Exit, and potentially a cult base. The jaunt will make a distinctive noise once it reaches the exit, letting any cultist near it at the time know that their base might be compromised.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a couple more country flag-bearing mugs. Mug boxes such as those included in Cafe Equipment supply crates now include a random one each.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Flag Mugs finally appear filled with liquid when some has been poured in them.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Re-did the in-hand icons for mugs, and added some for all flag mugs. Mugs that contain a liquid that has a unique mug sprite no longer appear invisible in-hand, and instead use the default mug sprite.</li>

				<li class="experiment">The Astral Journey cult rune has been completely reworked.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Using the rune no longer sends the user into sleep, allowing them to move as soon as they interrupt the ritual.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Improved the sprite generation of the cultified ghosts in general. The uniform and suit are now featured and partially truncated so only the upper body is visible.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Astral projections can now toggle (with a 5 sec cooldown) between a tangible and an intangible state.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">While intangible (the default) astral projections can move around like ghosts as usual, see in the dark, and now passively have the Seer rune&#39;s convertibility HUD, allowing cultists to plan for potential converts to abduct from the safety of their base. But most importantly, when speaking while intangible the player will speak directly into cult chat, giving them the ability to help coordinate their peers with unprecedented efficiency.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">While tangible however, the projection becomes visible and looks just like the user. Even tricking examination and sechuds (medhuds however will not appear over their heads). They are fairly limited still when it comes to physical interactions, they can bump into doors and casually talk with people, but they are completely unable to pick up any item, press any button or pull any object. Furthermore they will get dispelled should they take the slightest amount of damage. Their role is to either allow the cult to safely converse with the crew after their identity has been exposed, or to cause mischief. And if nothing else, to spook the crew.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">In either state, the projection will be dispelled should you move it to another Z-Level, or should your body be moved away from the rune (or from the tile if it was triggered from a talisman). If your body dies while still on top of the rune, your shade will materialize at the current location of your astral projection.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">To complement those changes, cult hoods now have a button that lets cultists hide their face and voice, potentially giving them the ability to perform highly visible deeds without necessarily compromising their identity (as long as they don&#39;t forget to remove their ID).</li>

				<li class="imageadd">Revamped the vinyl sprite. The label in the center is still red by default but can be customized for each different playlist.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Player-controlled Giant Spiders now have some sort of color-matrix powered night vision that lets them see quite well in the dark while still being able to identify lit areas, and therefore to seek lights to destroy. Might refine later. Feedback welcome.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Player-controlled Giant Spiders have a brand new HUD, featuring a health indicator, a fire warning, and a zone selection (for choosing which limb to target on humans). Spiderlings also have an indicator for their growth, while Nurse have indicators for both how many eggs they can lay, and how many spiders there are in total, as well as how many are needed before they can evolve into a Queen.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Player-controlled spiderlings are now able to ventcrawl (turns out they couldn&#39;t until now, despite NPC spiderlings being one of the only mob actually having an AI that lets it ventcrawl)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Player-controlled Giant Spiders now have spells for all their abilities that can be cast by players should they end up controlling one. This includes Spiderlings growing up (they get to choose whether to become Guard, Nurse or Hunter), as well as Nurse spinning webs, cocoons, laying eggs, and evolving into queens</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spider hunters are now twice faster, still slower than carps though.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Changed the requirements and logic behind spider nurses evolving into queens. Before nurses would instantly become queens if there were less than 5 queens in the world. Now there has to be at least 10 spiders total (including spiderlings) per queen in the world for an NPC nurse to evolve. It will then have a 10% chance per second to evolve. Player-controlled nurses only require 6 spiders per queen, ensuring that NPC nurses shouldn&#39;t cuck players out of becoming queens. As a side-effect, non-queen nurses will become more common once again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Spider queen projectiles no longer deal 5 brute damage, instead they root mobs to the floor just like blood nails do. As for those, resisting or clicking the webs will let you break out after one or two seconds. The queen can fire her projectile about every three or four seconds at best (BYOND time is uncertain).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the giant spider queen&#39;s projectile being invisible</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed NPC spider nurses laying two egg clusters when they should only be able to lay one, causing them to birth twice as many spiderlings as normal.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Empty Soul Gems can now be fitted into a Construct Shell, turning it into a Shade Beacon. Roaming shades can use the beacon to become a construct without the need for another player to slot them inside the shell, allowing cultists to prepare those in preparation of a fight (because once Act 3 hits no cultist has time to make you a soul gem or a shell, let alone deal with you).</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Wraiths have a new Wraith Tear spell (with 7.5 seconds cooldown) that essentially gives them warping claws ability. Just like with warping claws you can channel the ability by toggling throw mode. The portals created by Wraith Tear only last 3 seconds and do not connect atmospheres, nor create sparks when they close. Non-cultist carbons who pass through them will experience 3 seconds of cult confusion, along with dizziness and other misc. effects. Lastly those portals leave a blood splatter behind them.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Wraiths damage has been nerfed from 25 brute to 15 brute.</li>
				<li class="experiment">The intent is to have Wraith perform more of a support role directly on the field, unlike Artificers that generally stay in base or Juggernauts that go straight into fights. By having two movement spells Wraiths can more easily get out of danger (they have the lowest HP of all constructs now) While the ability to write down Path Runes makes them a valuable asset to the cult beyond getting rid of a nosy AI.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">New antag role! &#34;Syndicate Challengers&#34;. Roughly based on the old double-agents game mode. Remember to update your preferences to try it out.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Challengers are fairly similar to traitors in that they have an uplink, some TCs, even code words, however their single objective is to assassinate another challenger aboard the station, henceforth there&#39;s always at least 2 of them tasked with killing each others. When there are more than 2 challengers, their assassination orders are chained so that the first one hunts the second one, the second one hunts the third one, etc, until the last one who hunts the first one. Once an assassination has been successfully carried out and reported to the Syndicate, you take on your victim&#39;s target (unless it was you in which case no more objectives are given) and receive 5 additional TCs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">For a successful assassination to be permanently secured by the Syndicate, you must take a photo of your victim&#39;s dead (crit is enough) body, severed head, or brain, and publish it on any newscaster channel for all the crew to see their dead body. You can use any channel, but you may want to use your victim&#39;s ID to create one so as to keep the crew guessing as to your identity, or send the message with another stolen ID to send security on a red herring.</li>
				<li class="experiment">This variant on traitor puts the emphasis on robustness and direct confrontation between traitors, but the Syndicate doesn&#39;t care how the deed is performed so long as the kill is reported. Once it has, your victim&#39;s own assassination objective is forever marked as failed even if they get revived and their target dies later.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Cult conversions have been reworked! Details below.</li>
				<li class="experiment">The sounds produced by conversion runes can now only be heard by those who have a line of sight to the rune.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Automatic boxing now only happens to cult-banned players.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Refusing conversion now restrains you with ghastly bindings that hinders your movements through pain. It takes 1 minute to resist out of those.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Loyalty Implants no longer slow down conversions, but instead force-refuse them.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Setting your cult preferences to Never no longer auto-refuses conversions (you now always get the choice) but still displays your preferences as such to Seer users.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Non-cultists restrained by ghastly bindings show up on the altar&#39;s cult roster, and are valid Blood Magnetism targets (for both summoning and rejoining)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The pain induced by ghastly bindings fades over time, but gets reset when their victim travels through the veil (Path or Blood Magnetism runes)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The cultist who performed the conversion that restrained someone will instantly be informed should the bindings get removed. The bindings also remove themselves should another conversion attempt succeed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cultists no longer resist Loyalty Implanters, instead the implant pops out 10 seconds later.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All loyalty implanted cultists also get informed that they have 10 seconds before their implant pops out when Act 2 begins.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added holy implants. Can be ordered at cargo. Implanted cultists become unable to perform any ritual or use any cult spells. They also become unable to travel through the veil (Path Runes or Blood Magnetism) or be affected by Fervor. However they are destroyed upon conversion so they cannot be used preemptively unlike loyalty implants.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cultists with holy water in their body will also suffer from those impediments.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Cult deconversions are a thing once again 2 years and a half later. They work as such, first have the cultist (or suspected cultist) take a sip of holy water (splashing them from the flask also works, or giving them a holy wafer to eat, etc). Immediately after slap them with a bible on help intent (the target needs to have over 20hp or it won&#39;t work). Everyone can do it, not just chaplains. If the target wasn&#39;t a cultist, nothing unusual happens. Otherwise they will be knockdown and given the choice to abandon the cult or resist. In both cases after 10 seconds, they take 10 brute damage, and a pair of red shades appear. If they accepted the deconversion, those shades will immediately start attacking them, otherwise if they resisted the shades will attack the one who attempted the deconversion, and other nearby non-cultists.</li>
				<li class="experiment">If a chaplain performed the deconversion with a bible of their religion, those red shades have 20hp and deal 5 damage, making them about as much of an inconvenience as blob spores. Otherwise they will be as strong as regular shades.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bibles, Holy Water, Incense, and Thuribles are now available from Cargo as Religious Paraphernelia under Supplies.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cult mobs spawned by bloodstones no longer stand still for a while before attacking non-cultists, they instead immediately give chase once they spawn.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Blood Communion tattoo now also gives a small buff to blood regen.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Confusion runes sometimes causing people to remain blinded forever when they time-out.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed deculted players still having cult UI elements on their screen</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed splashing mobs with a holy water flask applying the equivalent of half the flask&#39;s current volume to them instead of only the 5u being spent.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the holy water flask having wrong in-hand sprites when facing some directions.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Using a soulstone on a cultist shade as a non-cultist now properly decults the shade.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">De-culted players now get a message specifying exactly what they remember about the cult, generally only the player who converted them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cultists can now use altars as operating tables with the same efficiency as if they were using an actual operating table. Furthermore, Blood Daggers can now be used as ghetto scalpels and circular saws, and Talismans can be used as ghetto hemostats.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Shades now take 1hp of damage per Life() tick while in space, killing them in about one or two minutes. So no more sitting in space breaking windows.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Shades also now take damage and get slowed by holy water just like constructs do.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Snaxi brig now has a private snowmobile storage/impound yard. The keys spawn in a locker.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Snaxi now hosts the new snow gear vendors. A number of other small quality of life changes as well.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Blizzards should be shorter on average.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Dark Season / Omega Blizzard is now adminbus only.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When slicing a door open with an esword (harm intent), it now dismantles the door like a ram.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Players may now use the &#34;Get unique job&#34; preference. This means it will not assign you to any job where someone else shares the same job slot. For example, if you high-pref botanist and there is already a botanist, it will try your medium preferences. If none of your preferences are empty, you will return to the lobby.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Trees (such as those on Snaxi) become transparent when you are within 2 tiles</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The labor console can now close extra slots if they have not been filled yet.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now build fireplaces out of bricks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There is now a snow gear vendor. Gear up to settle the snow, or just pick your favorite color scarf. It even has contraband and premium items...</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now build log walls by using a log on the snowy ground. It will try to use any logs on the ground before the one in your hand. It builds twice as fast if you clear the snow first.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When you build a new turf on unsimulated terrain, it will keep the same air mix, preventing ZAS while building.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can use one log on another to construct a storm door. Storm doors are wood doors that shut by themselves fairly quickly, keeping out the cold.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Pine logs are now worth 4 planks of wood, instead of just 2.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Asphalt roads now protect wires and pipes from being destroyed by explosions.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Geysers now properly smoke (vents do not smoke) and heat you up based on your proximity to the geyser. Unstable geysers can burn you fairly easily, so be careful!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Geysers can now melt nearby snow in a circle. Unstable geysers do it the fastest - melted snow? take it slow!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can shovel a geyser to fill it in and reduce the rate it puts out heat. Do it enough and you can seal it completely. Shovel a sealed geyser to completely remove it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Geysers hit by explosions can get sealed, but unstable geysers could go critical and spew out extreme heat. Call a suited atmospheric technician to seal it if this happens. Do not be tempted to build a thermoelectric generator around the critical geyser.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug where geysers wouldn&#39;t transfer heat to simulated turfs.</li>
