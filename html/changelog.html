				<li class="bugfix">Fixed proximity sensors not detecting (or detecting in extremely buggy ways) anything that wasn't a mob. This may have slight balance implications since you can chuck a pen towards them to activate them, so do definitely make a bug report if you think this shouldn't be intentional.</li>
