Salaries are now drawn directly from the station funds, with Nanotrasen then recharging it for the next payroll based on the default salaries (with an additional recharge before the payroll to take latejoiners into account), with an overhead of 10%. Effectively, that means all salaries are being increased by 10%. This also means that all salaries across the station will tank should the AI spend all the station funds on monkey cube crates, or get raised should miners ship lots of Plasma to Centcom.</li>

				<li class="tweak">The hack time for Malfunctioning AIs has been reverted to a flat 60 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">AI&#39;s can now swap between a cyborg shell and their main core!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">AI&#39;s can now create cyborg shells from completed cyborg skeletons that are visible to the AI. The AI can only have one shell at a time; the previous one must be destroyed before a new one can be made. The AI can gib their shell at any time using an action button. (Even while the shell is dead!)</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Cyborg exoskeletons can now be smashed apart with anything as strong as a toolbox. Doing so will destroy the exoskeleton but drop any attached parts (arms, legs, torso, head) on the ground. It will also make a good mess for the janitor to clean up.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">Centcomm Orders have been reworked and greatly expanded upon!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a ton of new Centcomm Orders that can be shipped at Cargo. Three random orders are created at round start, more are created every 20 to 40 minutes depending on the population on the crew manifest. Departments with already active orders/no population are way less likely to receive new orders.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Nanotrasen has also just remembered that they really like plasma and that was the reason why the Space Stations were first built in that system. Shipping Plasma sheets in crates will add money directly to the Station funds. The order for plasma sheets is always available.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cargo receives a bonus payment of 10% of the fulfilled order&#39;s value every time an order for an other department gets fulfilled.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Requested items can also be brought to the Emergency Shuttle instead of Cargo. They will be processed (but not deleted) when the shuttle reaches Centcom just as if they had been shipped through the Supply Shuttle (Requirements such as being in a crate or not still apply). Shipping items this way won&#39;t grant Cargo a bonus.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Departments that may receive orders will appear on the round end scoreboard in a leaderboard. All that matters to rank up is the money on the department&#39;s account at round end. Any way to increase that number (or reduce the number of other departments) are fair game. Try to have your department reach rank 1!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When a Centcomm Order is created, the Request Consoles of the concerned departments will receive a message (wow those finally have a purpose?)</li>

				<li class="tweak">Tweaked the ambience sounds of the Research Outpost. The Outpost Engineering/Atmos rooms now properly emit the same ambience as those on the station.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Here&#39;s a bunch of Xenoarch and Research Oupost fixes and tweaks</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed analysis trays not having their sprite update when reagents are added or removed from them.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the analysis machines only heating up when idle and not when scanning, regardless of the temperature of the air around them.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the analysis machines heating up at an absurd rate. I removed the cap on entropy so cold air in the pen where the machines are is a lot more efficient at keeping them at working temperatures. The rate at which they heat up now depends on their power consumption which has been reworked for both their idle and active states.</li>
				<li class="experiment">This means however that the machines will overheat if you try to use them at room temperature. From now on when you arrive at the outpost and plan to do triangulation later, remember to turn on the Freezer so the pen has time to cool down. Upgrading the machines with phasic scanning modules or better however will let them complete the scan before they have time to overheat, so that&#39;s an alternative.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The temperature gauge on the machines now goes all the way from 0K to 400K.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Replaced the Nitrogen Pressure Tank with a Plasma Canister on top of a connector port on all maps (I used a Plasma Pressure Tank on maps where the canister couldn&#39;t be reached) which has much better specific heat and thus is much better at keeping the pen cold.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed the extra Air Alarm and vents in the Anomalous Materials Lab pen since it would always trigger alarms if you started cooling. Added a Gas Meter on the floor instead that can be examined from afar to check the pen&#39;s temperature.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the Research Outpost Atmospherics&#39; Gas Mixer taking 80 percent Oxygen and 20 percent Nitrogen instead of the other way around. It&#39;s been like that since forever? jesus christ.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Lots of small changes to the box Research Outpost beside the Anomalous Materials Lab. Removed one of the SMES, a single one is enough to keep the outpost powered for almost 4 hours, and extended the hallway with an airlock on the other side of the transit tube so you can easily set up the solars in the crate next to them, which have been found after testing to keep the outpost powered for up to 11 hours if set up early. Also added a Power Monitoring Computer to the Outpost Power Substation. Lots of other small QoL changes, moves items on tables a bit, added a Newscaster, a Mousecube box, added a pair of Suspension Field Gens to the Temporary storage for old times sake. Replaced the tables with the redundant pickaxe and excavation picks with crates that xenoarchaeologists can use to easily gather their small finds, along with a table on which can be found the new revamped Xenoarchaeology manual.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Said manual, Out on the Dig New Edition! also features a new sprite.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The outposts of other maps have been tweaked a bit as well, but mostly just the Anomalous Materials Lab pen, and the new Out on the Dig manual.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Big Xenoarchaeology update!</li>
				<li class="imageadd">The depth scanner, digsite locators, core sampler, rock sliver, as well as the solution trays all have new sprites.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The core sampler now works without the need for sample bags, but takes one second to extract a sample. It&#39;s got sounds now too.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can use a pen on a rock sliver to label it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Edited the description of rock slivers, some of the xenoarch-related reagents, as well as the xenoarch sample analysis machines to help players understand each of their purposes.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed the beacon, and locater device from Excavation Tools closets due to their utmost uselessness in regard to the job. The locater (renamed locator) device however can now be acquired from the Protolathe at Bluespace Tech Level 2. It still looks just like the disk pinpointer though.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The xenoarchaeological digsite locator has been buffed to always show digsite material colors (requires Anomaly Tech Level 3)</li>
				<li class="tweak">The advanced xenoarchaeological digsite locator has been buffed to also highlight turfs with buried large artifacts (requires Anomaly Tech Level 4)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Alden-Saraspova Counter is FINALLY available from RnD, barely 4 years after I added the fucking tech tree, and gives you the distance to the closest Large Artifact. You can also fit them in your excavation belt (requires Anomaly Tech Level 5)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Hard Disk Drives. As useless as Corrupted Data Disks, and both may now be found in maint loot spawners</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Encrypted HDD (Anomaly Tech 5), now spawned by Anomaly Analysers when a large artifact gets analyzed for the first time. Replaces that anomaly tech data that used to be in the Anomaly Report. Deconstructing one of those is enough to get the advanced xenoarchaeological digsite locator which will highlight buried large artifacts.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The distance to the nearest artifact given by the Fourier transform spectroscope is a lot more reliable now that it counts distance in a circle rather than a square.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can slap Artifact Analysis reports onto Anomaly Containers, allowing people who examine the container to read the report.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Anomaly Containers are now access restricted to science. You can break them open still using an emag, guns, or explosions.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Anomaly Containers have a slightly different appearance when containing a large artifact, or when broken.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Placing a Large Artifact into an anomaly container automatically toggles off its effects.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Large Artifacts that have both been analyzed and had their primary effect activated at least once now add points to the crew score (wow, scientists can finally contribute to the crew score lol)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You once again have a very small chance of finding a Syndicate Beacon instead of a Large Artifact in Xenoarch. You can use it to become a traitor, but the beacon will explode after a short delay if you were already part of another faction, or antag banned.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Unlike the old Syndicate Beacon, it can be re-used, but subsequent traitorifications will require admin approval, so you&#39;ll be able to write a cover letter to the Syndicate for why they should hire you. If you bother admins too much, they will detonate the beacon.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">The Syndicate Beacon now has its own sprite that looks a bit like a laptop, separating it for good from the wish granter.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Since I was confused at first between the Syndicate Beacon and the Singularity Beacon, I judged a good idea to have a regular non-syndicate Singularity Beacon spawn as well among the large finds. It has the same rarity as a large Supermatter Crystal, given its round-ending potential.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Upped the rarity of Construct Shells so they&#39;re more common than the round ending items.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a few large artifacts such as the Warping Claws, the Essence Printer and the Communication Crystal being deemed mundane by the Anomaly Analyzer.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A new edition of the Out on the Dig manual is out! Now with information actually relevant to the job of xenoarchaeology!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new item to the RD&#39;s locker. The Anomalous Energies Locator, which locates the closest currently activated Artifact or Anomaly Power Utilizer on the current Z Level. Something to help deal with rogue Xenoarchaeologists.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed large artifacts with a touch effect not visibly activating, or being logged.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">a single use Cult Pamphlet can now spawn instead of a large artifact, just like Vampire stone masks and Changeling vials. Same rarity too, which is to say, extremely low.</li>
