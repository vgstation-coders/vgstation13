				<li class="rscadd">The following changes are to Defficiency</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ported over metaclubs Centcomm, so ERT and Deathsquad can exist and more room for bus</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Vox Skipjack from box, so now Vox Raiders can happen on Defficiency</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the salvage shuttle to Z level 6, but as Defficiency is defficient of an aux-docking port, it cant dock to the station properly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Fixed a piping error in xenobiology, gave it and the research corridor some more vents considering the size</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Expanded the xenobotany area on the research outpost. It now also has gas-controlled trays (just need to wrench them down)</li>

			<h3 class="author">Sood updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">Deus Ex Update:</li>
				<li class="tweak">(Deus Ex Update hijacked by Sood from N3X15)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Lungs are now fully modular and actually process gas for humans.  Lungs must be compatible with a species or they will die of suffocation.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Vox and Plasmamen have their own lungs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Most species currently exhale CO<sub>2</sub>.  Vox may be tweaked later to exhale N<sub>2</sub>O. Plasmamen exhale oxygen, though.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Robotics can make Advanced Lungs (programming 2, biomech 4), which are compatible with all species and filter out some gasses (N2O and plasma), up to certain partial pressures.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Livers are also modular and can be set to enhance "natural" removal rates of reagents. Nothing yet makes any use of this, so all livers are standard UNTIL YOU CODE IT.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Livers which are bruised will deal toxin damage to their owner if the user has any toxic reagents in their system. Ethanol with a bruised liver is extremely dangerous.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Livers become damaged over time if their owner has a lot of toxin damage. Doctors beware.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Eyes are modular and Advanced Type 1 eyes can grant enhanced nightvision and built-in welder goggles.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Unid updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added cages. Mobs inside cages can interact with the outside world, unless the cage's cover is closed. Alt-clicking a cage will toggle its cover. Cages with closed covers can be used to safely transport hostile animals (or assistants).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cages can be crafted with 6 plasteel sheets.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">2016.02.17</h2>
			<h3 class="author">9600bauds updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Cryo cells now pop you out at a safe temperature once again, though just cold enough to give you the jitters for a few seconds. However, it takes 4 seconds to eject somebody from a Cryo cell. Essentially, the Mancrowave's body heat regulation functionality was directly implemented into Cryo.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cryo cells now also give a short period of grace to non-oxygen-breathing races after being ejected from Cryo, in which they won't breathe (and Plasmamen won't combust) so that they may be given internals safely. This is to replace the effects of post-cryo Hypothermia, which made people not breathe.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">2016.02.16</h2>
			<h3 class="author">JoeMother0 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

			<h2 class="date">2016.02.15</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Unid updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Baby carps now attack unconscious mobs. When they attack living mobs enough times, they grow up.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Baby carps can be fed by attacking them with meat. Feeding them has a slight chance of making them your friend, and will eventually cause them to grow up.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Baby animals now consider their mother's friends their friends. This applies to space carps, too</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">2016.02.14</h2>
			<h3 class="author">9600bauds updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a very bizzare bug that could result in humans (especially lings, monkeymen, and head transplanted players) having TWO different blood types, each one of them only used for certain things.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Monkeymen will now properly have randomized blood types.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Players will now have randomized blood types as well. Random blood types follow a weighted distribution. Hopefully this will save Medbay from a lot of headaches.</li>
				<li class="experiment">The blood type distribution is as follows: 36% O+, 28% A+, 20% B+, 5% AB+, 4% O-, 3% A-, 1% B-, 1% AB-. This is the same distribution Monkeymen were supposed to have, although a bug prevented it from working properly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Your blood type is now added to your character notes when you spawn, in case you lose your ID (use the 'notes' verb, IC tab). You can check on other people's blood type by examining their ID or using the Medical Records database.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a 'Wake-Up Cycle' option to Sleepers, which will try to wake up the occupant. This is intended to work as an alternative to the Mancrowave. Alt-clicking a Sleeper while an occupant is inside will automatically start this cycle.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the Paralysis Summary timer not working properly on Sleepers (this will give you an approximation of how long the occupant's paralysis/sleep would last if left alone).</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Shadowmech88 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added the blunderbuss.</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">xpcybic updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="wip">The following changes apply to Taxistation.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Redesigned almost all of medbay with the goal of reducing cramp and improving workflow between departments.

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Had to hand in my Pull Request to the Chief - He'd always had it out for me, and the code ain't ever been in my favour, not since the war anyway. I looked it all over once more, tryin' to get to the bottom of this mystery, but it ain't easy finding bugs in some downtrodden code like this.I thought of that paddy dame that showed up in my office last week, asking for me to help her. Said someone called 'Gene Ettics' went AWOL. I told her I'd do what I could, and that's why I'm here. I opened up my flask of brandy and took a sip. It was going to be a long night. Chief or no chief, I'm getting to the bottom of this case.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added the "Hostile Infestation" event. Similar to the normal infestation event, though this time with hostile mobs</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added "Silent Meteors" event. Adminbus only, not random, allows for admins to send meteors without a command report. I'm sure this will never be abused, ever.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added "Mass Drunkenness" event. Causes everyone on the station to be drunk for less than a minute.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added "Mass Hallucination", "Silent Meteors", "Hostile Infestation", "Organic Debris Field", and "Mass Drunkenness" events to admin secrets panel. Any admin with +FUN can access them.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">When making bottles at a Chemmaster, you will now be prompted to input how many bottles you want to make before being prompted to name the bottles.

If the limb is so damaged that it would immediately break again after setting the bone, it will now heal to just under bone fracture levels. Note that this effectively lets you heal brute damage on dead people.</li>

				<li class="experiment">SUMMARY</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Heat transfer Rehaul</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hypothermia added</li>
				<li class="rscadd">changes to things that cause cold damage</li>
				<li class="rscadd">space blankets</li>
				<li class="rscadd">ghetto space suits with space blankets</li>
				<li class="rscadd">thermal homeostasis regulator that when emagged becomes the mancrowave</li>
				<li class="tweak">changes to cryo</li>
				<li class="experiment">INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HEAT TRANSFER</li>
				<li class="tweak">removes useless variables heat_protection & cold_protection as these were in 99% of circumstances the exact same as body_parts_covered</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added a new variable, heat_conductivity to all items, determining how fast they conduct heat away from you</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added new procs to humans, sweat() & burn_calories() - Now whenever you use up nutriment, you generate heat, but can also expend nutriment to decrease heat.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">refactored how heat transfer away from humans worked ( see above)</li>
				<li class="experiment">INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HYPOTHERMIA</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added Mild Hypothermia (between 32 and 35C) - this results in shivering, minor slowdown and messages informing the player that they are cold.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added Moderate hypothermia (between 28 and 32C) - Shivering stops, slowdown increases, may slur/stutter words, chance of dropping items in hand and collapsing temporarily, as well as a 25% chance of forgetting how to use machines like when braindamaged</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added severe hypothermia (24 to 28C), shivering stops, player is unconcious, pulse decreases to 30BPM and has a 25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, which decreases over time as you are still breathing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added profound hypothermia (less than 24C), pulse stops, player has a 25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, does not decrease over time as they are not breathing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">CHANGES THINGS WHICH CAUSE COLD DAMAGE, including but not limited to coldingtons, cryokinesis, showers, goliaths, temperature gun, and chemicals which chill people. Foam fire extinguishers are not affected.</li>
				<li class="experiment">THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR</li>
				<li class="experiment">Please use this when taking someone out of cryo</li>
				<li class="tweak">When a person is dragged in, it will automatically begin stabilising, there is no need for more buttons to be pressed</li>
				<li class="tweak">Takes 5 seconds to heat/cool someone to 37C, which works out as quicker than shaking someone up.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Can be emagged to allow for three extra settings - this process is extremely visible, and there is a different sprite for when an emagged function is used</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Can reenable security features to quickly unemag the device and Can bring the device to an emergency stop.</li>
				<li class="experiment">CHANGES TO CRYO</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cryo now releases someone at 23C instead of -12C (or 25C if they manually eject)</li>
				<li class="experiment">PLEASE USE THE THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR AFTER TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF CRYO</li>
				<li class="tweak">Manual eject time brought down from 2 minutes to 30 seconds to make it time-neutral</li>
				<li class="tweak">This means that, as the person is ejected below profound hypothermia, they will not breathe until they heat up a wee bit further. This is a positive change, as vox & plasmamen will no longer die from toxin damage/fire immediately after leaving cryo.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">People inside a cryo cell do not suffer from hypothermia until leaving.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Massive rework to Botany mutations and Botany in general. PLEASE remember to use the in-game reporter for any bugs/issues you encounter! The changes here are not final and feedback is appreciated.</li>
				<li class="spellcheck">This changelog is a very simplified version, it does not cover all the changes. To see the full changelog, check out the PR in Github: https://github.com/d3athrow/vgstation13/pull/6734</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added 6 new plant traits, as well as many new non-stat mutations. A few plant traits that could previously only be obtained through Cargo exotic seeds can now also be obtained through mutations.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Some mutations will have effect on the grown fruit and require special handling. If you see a mutant banana lying around on the hallway, you may want to examine it before touching it.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Botany stat mutations will no longer give random stat penalties. All stat-related changes from mutations are now strictly positive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">For stat-increasing mutations, the strength of the mutation will be directly proportional to the amount of mutage used. Example: 10u mutagen will improve a stat twice as much as 5u would. Mutations are now 100% guaranteed for any amount of mutagen, just that small amounts will give weak mutations.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New mutation system adds a bit of depth to mutagen usage: Using more than 10-ish units of mutagen at a time will give you potentially dangerous effects.</li>
				<li class="tweak">As you improve your plants, they will start to build up resistance to small mutagen doses. Past a certain point, you may experience diminishing returns from mutations, and you may want to use bigger dosage (though be wary of the potential for dangerous results!)</li>
				<li class="experiment">Adult plants WILL NO LONGER MUTATE SPECIES. To cause species mutations, you need to add mutagen to a young plant (less than 60ish seconds of life). For a better explanation, see the full changelog.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Robust Harvest no longer temporarily increases yield. Now gradually improves your plant's potency stat, with a couple subtle downsides. Diethylamine now makes your plant grow faster, as well as gradually increase it's lifespan an endurance. Clonexadone massively heals plants on trays, as well as induce rapid reverse aging.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floral Somatorays now work 100% of the time. You can now right-click them to change the strength of the ensuing mutation when set to "Induce Mutations" (X mutation strength is equivalent to X units of mutagen). Now sometimes give a free yield-increasing mutation when under "Induce Mutations" mode.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hydroponics Trays will now change their name to match the plant growing in them. You can now label trays by right-clicking them.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Improper plant conditions (not enough water/nutriment/light etc) will now slightly slow your plant's growth.</li>
				<li class="tweak">A few changes to Exotic Seeds to make them slightly healthier and slightly more fun.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spreading plants (i.e. Kudzu) will no longer leave an empty tray when planted. Now require being fully mature before spawning vines. You can prevent vines from spawning by keeping the plant fed: Kudzu won't try to spread unless it has less than 80% nutriment and water.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Plant-b-Gone used as a spray now targets space vines in a 3x3 area around itself. Scythes now have a 1 second cooldown when used. Added a Heavy-Duty Pneumatic Scythe, can be attached to Ripleys. Some strains of Kuzdu can become resistant to certain types of damage through mutations.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Xenobotany gene injector now has two modes: Splice and Purge. Added two more Xenobotany genes, and modified existing ones somewhat.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Condensed Capsaicin now requires Capsaicin and Ethanol to produce.</li>
				<li class="tweak">IV Drips now give their increased transfer speed to any container that has only blood inside, rather than only IV bags.</li>
