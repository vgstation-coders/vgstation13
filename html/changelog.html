			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Airflow is now visible, as dust motes can be seen flying around between zones when the pressure differential is high enough for there to be wind.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">jwhitak updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds wooden buckets! Two wood planks to craft.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Friendly carp ranching will no longer result in hostile carp.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Circular saws and variants can chop down trees.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes certain sounds from being heard from further away than intended.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tools/surgery tools without sounds will attempt to play other possibly related sounds before giving up.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Wooden walls and girders now take time to chop down (5 seconds). Fireaxes are faster (1 second).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now wet hides in a sink/groundwater, and air dry them slowly. Hot rooms still dry them faster.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Wet leather now tells you if it&#39;s drying, and how much it has left to dry.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed wet leather deleting itself in your hands.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2024.08.09</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Pancakemines updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Surgery freezers now blink when containing brains with a player ghost inside them.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Added new pulsing heart surgery box sprite.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">SonixApache updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Detective scanners can now be alt-clicked to switch to scan-only mode, which prevents it from being put into boxes/coats/etc. Do note that this also prevents the scanner from taking fingerprint cards.</li>
				<li class="experiment">You can now use hand labelers on storage items like boxes and backpacks, among other things. If you notice something breaking with labelling, report it.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2024.08.07</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Eneocho updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Squash plants! Mutate a pumpkin to get your very own squash. They are not as efficient at making nutriment, but are filled with precious Squash (reagent).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Squash reagent/drug is a double edged performance enhancer that boosts your tackling abilities. If consumed by non dwarves, they&#39;ll suffer brute damage for 30s before turning into a dwarf (as long as Squash is still in their system). If they run out of squash, the recoil from growing back to normal size will break every bone in their body, unless their bones were reinforced with Degencalcium beforehand.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Squash drug can be manufactured by mixing equal parts Manly Dorf, Degenerate Calcium and Hyperzine.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Caber can now self recharge once per minute and has the proper sharpness flags when on its detonated state.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Methamphetamine can be made stationside by enterprising chemists. Slower and way more expensive to make but overall better than hyperzine, and performance enhancing, too. It does make you tweak out at times, though. Made by mixing 1 part Albuterol, 3 parts Hydrogen, 1 part Chlorine and 5u Carbon (catalyst), then heating to 200Â°C, which makes 2 parts meth.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">boy2mantwicethefam updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">A neo-ultra-capitalism mode Old Vendotron will no longer kill itself by summoning a lot of hostile creatures that it would proceed to go to combat with, and now the creatures it creates become part of the same faction as it.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the Old Vendotron&#39;s plate attack so that it will no longer throw plates on its own tile. It will now properly throw them away.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slimes will now become ravenous in the presence of monkeys, causing them to become hungry and thus try to eat anything they can reach (including the monkeys), which also allows the slimes to feed far sooner on the monkeys than they otherwise would.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slimes can now store slightly more nutrition, meaning that they can develop into adult slimes and then split by eating two monkeys in a smaller form instead of having to eat a monkey in a smaller form and another monkey in a larger form.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">hacker-on-steroids updated:</h3>

				<li class="bugfix">Added keybinds for Soul Blade spells (courtesy of Yred). In regular mode, press Insert to Spin and End to Perforate. In Hotkey mode, press F to Spin and R to Perforate.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Using click-drag to perform the Perforate spell as a Soul Blade no longer sends you always south if you click-drag from the Soul Blade&#39;s tile. (courtesy of Yred)</li>

				<li class="bugfix">(Admins) Changing the &#34;detachable_cell&#34; variable for energy weapons will now also handle whether it will give the gun the respective &#34;Detach Cell&#34; verb or not.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug where a person that has carp pheromones in their system would not stink up the place properly if someone nearby was dead, which would unpredictably cause the message to not reliably show up to other players in the area.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2024.07.31</h2>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Hologram Projectors nullspacing items worn or held by holograms when they die.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Hologram Projector player transitions between pAI and Hologram (quickly swapping from one to the other should no longer cause any issues)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the Hologram Projector&#39;s ray not properly tracking the hologram or its projector in most cases.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">pAI slotted inside a Hologram Projector can now re-spawn their hologram if it disappeared without requiring outside help, using a new button under the pAI Commands tab.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added a wider amount of content to the Trader&#39;s &#34;Yamtar&#34; crate, containing unique items that can greatly aid in medical endeavors.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The &#34;Yamtar&#34; crate is slightly less likely to have a suit sensing wand.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">DNA syringes that contain a single block will now have the block&#39;s number in their name.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Genetics&#39; DNA Scanner&#39;s &#34;transfer&#34; function will now only irradiate as much as a DNA injector would, which is far less.</li>

			<h3 class="author">Eneocho updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Wizards can upgrade the Pitbull spell to summon Toadline Pitbulls for 20 spell points. Toadline Pitbulls move slightly slower than a regular pitbull, but have the advantage of being able to pass through airlocks and other mobs unimpeded (the airlock pass is NOT instantaneous, it takes a bit). They also do 1 more Brute damage on average compared to a regular Pitbull.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Restores the Tracking Bacon dish that was commented out 12 years ago. They behave like regular tracking beacons, but can be eaten and can be cooked with 10u corn oil, 5u salt and a slab of meat.</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">boy2mantwicethefam updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug where reviving at least twice with the phylactery would completely wipe out the lich&#39;s list of spells.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a runtime caused by an attempt to find a spell&#39;s button in the spell menu when it didn&#39;t have any (such as the No Gun Allowed spell)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">A soulstone that is used to fuel a phylactery will now properly change to its inert icon. It will also no longer allow the user for a brief period of time to summon the shade it just used on the phylactery, which did nothing.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug where certain elements for the No Gun Allowed, Bind Object and Magical Wardrobe spells were not being properly transferred due to a missing &#34;user&#34; variable.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">No Gun Allowed will now properly allow someone to fire a weapon again when removed.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug where the wizard and wizard&#39;s apprentice scoreboards would show spells learned from spellbooks as being absorbed.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Should fix an error with the wizard and wizard&#39;s apprentice scoreboard where spells would show up at least twice, and generally improved them a little.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Adjusted the phylactery set&#39;s spawns so that the phylactery itself is more likely to appear above the necromancer clothes instead of under them.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Removed unused code regarding monkeys being attacked with items, and the monkeys already take damage through other systems.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a 7-year-old bug where slimes wouldn&#39;t do roughly 4 of the emotes they were meant to do once in a while because the emote system was checking to see if they were a monkey. They can now bounce, jiggle, light up for a bit and vibrate.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Creatures and silicons that are attacked by burn-causing melee weapons such as the scrying orb will no longer be spammed with &#34;Aargh it burns!&#34; in every attack.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Cleaned a section of the game&#39;s code where item attacks against slimes were defined. It should now be easier for future coders to read the piece of code where it used to be.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Surrendering via a character that wasn&#39;t male nor female should no longer say &#34;they surrender%s!&#34;, and will now properly say &#34;they surrender!&#34;.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a 7-year-old bug where non-sharp items with enough force did not have any chance of ripping off a limb as opposed to turning it into gibs. The check has now been fixed and now strong blunt melee weapons have a chance to rip off a broken limb instead of gibbing a broken limb.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Removed unused code which concerned attacking with slimes in order to cause brain damage, which was unused for a variety of reasons including; regular slimes cannot be picked up, the code only works with items, and it only worked against non-carbon mobs which, as far as I know, are not affected by brain damage.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Emotes that change their wording based on the user&#39;s gender will now properly affect non-humans such as monkeys.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Removed an unused proc that was getting called by the code regarding monkeys being attacked with items.</li>

				<li class="experiment">The Cult Eclipse Update is here!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cultists have a new UI Panel that enables easier tracking of the cult&#39;s members, their objectives, and lots of other important information.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">As cultists perform occult activities and complete objectives, they generate devotion which both grants them Tattoos imbued with new powers, but also quickens the arrival of the new Eclipse event.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">During the Eclipse, all lights aboard the station are dimmed, highly reducing visibility. The cult can use the new (very old in fact) Tear Reality rune during the eclipse to start a ritual that can let them end the round. If the Eclipse ends without the ritual being attempted, the crew will be safe from Nar-Sie for this round.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If the cult attempts to raise Nar-Sie, they will have to defend a Blood Stone for a certain amount of time, and from that point onward all cultists will have a visible halo betraying their appearance to the crew. If the Blood Stone is destroyed, the ritual will end, and the cult will receive various handicaps, such has the halo remaining visible, and the cultist cap falling to zero.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Scoreboard now lists cultists in order of how much devotion they generated. The cult now &#34;wins&#34; or &#34;loses&#34; following various conditions, each with a different message on the scoreboard. A cult that couldn&#39;t raise Nar-Sie can still get a victory by having some of its members escape alive and free aboard the shuttle.</li>

				<li class="experiment">The Paint &amp; Linen Update is here! A world of acrylic, fabric, and glue opens before you.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Detailed changelog here: `https://github.com/vgstation-coders/vgstation13/pull/35451`</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Reworked from scratch how paint mixes and interact with floors, walls, and everything in general. You can craft acrylic paint in Chemistry by first mixing glue, and then adding some pigments.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Glue is a new (previously unused) reagent that applies to object the same effect that school glue applies, but for only a minute. Can be washed off with water. Creates splatters on the floor that slow down mobs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can use Paint Rollers from Art Vendors to paint floors and walls without consuming reagents, and painting only parts of a tile.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Paint Remover has been reworked into Acetone, and can be obtained either from the Art Vendor, or brewed in Chemistry.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new Vox Trader bundle: the Nano Painter&#39;s toolbox. Nano Paint when applied over a whole tile will cause it to emit its own light. When used on canvas the parts painted with it will glow in the dark.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Nano Paint may also be crafted in Xenobiology by adding Phazon to a Pyrite Slime.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new Botany plant, Flax, whose product can be either grinded for Flax Oil which is a type of paint that partially matches the color of its surrounding reagents (pouring the mixture between two beakers a few times will cause the flax oil to match the other reagents&#39; color completely). Flax may also be processed into cloth using either a Spinning Wheel crafted out of Wood, or an Electric Loom produced by R&amp;D.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cloth can now be used to craft some simple items by hand, or more intricate clothing by using Knitting Needles crafted out of wood, or a Sewing Machine produced by R&amp;D.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">After adding some pigments inside a cauldron, you can dye crafted items in it either fully, or partially depending on the item. Bedsheets can be dyed as well.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Using Knitting Needles or a Sewing Machine, you can toggle the appearance of bedsheets between their old plaid look and their new wider look.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">R&amp;D may also now print the High Roller, a large paint roller that lets you easily and efficiently apply reagents over a large area. This applies to paint, but also bleach, acetone, lube, everything you can think of. If the reagent is a pigment, it will cover floors like paint does.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Re-Sprited Painting Brushes, Palettes, Paint Buckets, and added in-hand icons for all.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Metal Buckets similar to Paint Buckets can now be crafted from metal sheets.</li>
				<li class="tweak">the old Bucket is now called Plastic Bucket, and can be crafted from Plastic, or from the Biogenerator.</li>
				<li class="tweak">the Colorful Syndrome disease effect has been reworked, and now splatters the surroundings of the infected mob with paint instead of using chem smoke.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now toggle hoods on mannequins or other players by using the stripping menu.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some machines now automatically appear higher when built on top of tables, or when tables are placed below them, and return to their default offset when the table is removed or flipped.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Implemented a new subsystem that revamps the way reagent containers normalize their temperature in relation to the environment. This new method makes reagents reach room temperature quite faster on average (except when using a Stasis Beaker), and has been finely adjusted so temperature changes are more noticeable while also feeling realistic. You can Alt Middle click a beaker or food item to blow some air on them and accelerate the process. As an added bonus, this system consumes a negligible amount of CPU compared to the one in effect until now, and is much simpler to read and adjust, thus more maintainable.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">The Wizard&#39;s &#34;Punch&#34; spell will now also make both the wizard and their target immune to the damage caused by any shrapnel launched by the ensuing explosion. It will not, however, cancel any effect that the shrapnel may have, such as bolas entangling their targets.</li>

They also come with a shaker, a rag and cooking tools out of the box, and get spicy chemicals and a new toy when emagged.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The service cyborg chef upgrade has been removed as it is now part of their standard loadout.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Service gripper can now pick up more things (basically everything the Rapid Service Fabricator can create, plus things needed in the kitchen). The gripper can now be directly synthesized to from the RSF.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Rapid Service Fabricator no longer throws sparks all over the place when selecting what to fabricate. Instead it plays a clicking sound.</li>
