				<li class="rscadd">Added different species of cyber horror for each playable race (except diona, because nanobots have no effect on dionae)</li>

I looked it all over once more, tryin' to get to the bottom of this mystery, but it ain't easy finding bugs in some downtrodden code like this.I thought of that paddy dame that showed up in my office last week, asking for me to help her. Said someone called 'Gene Ettics' went AWOL. I told her I'd do what I could, and that's why I'm here. I opened up my flask of brandy and took a sip. It was going to be a long night.

				<li class="rscadd">thermal homeostasis regulator that when emagged becomes the mancrowave</li>
				<li class="tweak">changes to cryo</li>
				<li class="experiment">INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HEAT TRANSFER</li>
				<li class="tweak">removes useless variables heat_protection & cold_protection as these were in 99% of circumstances the exact same as body_parts_covered</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added a new variable, heat_conductivity to all items, determining how fast they conduct heat away from you</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added new procs to humans, sweat() & burn_calories() - Now whenever you use up nutriment, you generate heat, but can also expend nutriment to decrease heat.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">refactored how heat transfer away from humans worked ( see above)</li>
				<li class="experiment">INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HYPOTHERMIA</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added Mild Hypothermia (between 32 and 35C) - this results in shivering, minor slowdown and messages informing the player that they are cold.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added Moderate hypothermia (between 28 and 32C) - Shivering stops, slowdown increases, may slur/stutter words, chance of dropping items in hand and collapsing temporarily, as well as a 25% chance of forgetting how to use machines like when braindamaged</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added severe hypothermia (24 to 28C), shivering stops, player is unconcious, pulse decreases to 30BPM and has a 25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, which decreases over time as you are still breathing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added profound hypothermia (less than 24C), pulse stops, player has a 25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, does not decrease over time as they are not breathing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">CHANGES THINGS WHICH CAUSE COLD DAMAGE, including but not limited to coldingtons, cryokinesis, showers, goliaths, temperature gun, and chemicals which chill people. Foam fire extinguishers are not affected.</li>
				<li class="experiment">THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR</li>
				<li class="experiment">Please use this when taking someone out of cryo</li>
				<li class="tweak">When a person is dragged in, it will automatically begin stabilising, there is no need for more buttons to be pressed</li>
				<li class="tweak">Takes 5 seconds to heat/cool someone to 37C, which works out as quicker than shaking someone up.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Can be emagged to allow for three extra settings - this process is extremely visible, and there is a different sprite for when an emagged function is used</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Can reenable security features to quickly unemag the device and Can bring the device to an emergency stop.</li>
				<li class="experiment">CHANGES TO CRYO</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cryo now releases someone at 23C instead of -12C (or 25C if they manually eject)</li>
				<li class="experiment">PLEASE USE THE THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR AFTER TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF CRYO</li>
				<li class="tweak">Manual eject time brought down from 2 minutes to 30 seconds to make it time-neutral</li>
				<li class="tweak">This means that, as the person is ejected below profound hypothermia, they will not breathe until they heat up a wee bit further. This is a positive change, as vox & plasmamen will no longer die from toxin damage/fire immediately after leaving cryo.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">People inside a cryo cell do not suffer from hypothermia until leaving.</li>

				<li class="spellcheck">This changelog is a very simplified version, it does not cover all the changes. To see the full changelog, check out the PR in Github: https://github.com/d3athrow/vgstation13/pull/6734</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added 6 new plant traits, as well as many new non-stat mutations. A few plant traits that could previously only be obtained through Cargo exotic seeds can now also be obtained through mutations.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Some mutations will have effect on the grown fruit and require special handling. If you see a mutant banana lying around on the hallway, you may want to examine it before touching it.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Botany stat mutations will no longer give random stat penalties. All stat-related changes from mutations are now strictly positive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">For stat-increasing mutations, the strength of the mutation will be directly proportional to the amount of mutage used. Example: 10u mutagen will improve a stat twice as much as 5u would. Mutations are now 100% guaranteed for any amount of mutagen, just that small amounts will give weak mutations.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New mutation system adds a bit of depth to mutagen usage: Using more than 10-ish units of mutagen at a time will give you potentially dangerous effects.</li>
				<li class="tweak">As you improve your plants, they will start to build up resistance to small mutagen doses. Past a certain point, you may experience diminishing returns from mutations, and you may want to use bigger dosage (though be wary of the potential for dangerous results!)</li>
				<li class="experiment">Adult plants WILL NO LONGER MUTATE SPECIES. To cause species mutations, you need to add mutagen to a young plant (less than 60ish seconds of life). For a better explanation, see the full changelog.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Robust Harvest no longer temporarily increases yield. Now gradually improves your plant's potency stat, with a couple subtle downsides. Diethylamine now makes your plant grow faster, as well as gradually increase it's lifespan an endurance. Clonexadone massively heals plants on trays, as well as induce rapid reverse aging.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floral Somatorays now work 100% of the time. You can now right-click them to change the strength of the ensuing mutation when set to "Induce Mutations" (X mutation strength is equivalent to X units of mutagen). Now sometimes give a free yield-increasing mutation when under "Induce Mutations" mode.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hydroponics Trays will now change their name to match the plant growing in them. You can now label trays by right-clicking them.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Improper plant conditions (not enough water/nutriment/light etc) will now slightly slow your plant's growth.</li>
				<li class="tweak">A few changes to Exotic Seeds to make them slightly healthier and slightly more fun.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spreading plants (i.e. Kudzu) will no longer leave an empty tray when planted. Now require being fully mature before spawning vines. You can prevent vines from spawning by keeping the plant fed: Kudzu won't try to spread unless it has less than 80% nutriment and water.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Plant-b-Gone used as a spray now targets space vines in a 3x3 area around itself. Scythes now have a 1 second cooldown when used. Added a Heavy-Duty Pneumatic Scythe, can be attached to Ripleys. Some strains of Kuzdu can become resistant to certain types of damage through mutations.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Xenobotany gene injector now has two modes: Splice and Purge. Added two more Xenobotany genes, and modified existing ones somewhat.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Condensed Capsaicin now requires Capsaicin and Ethanol to produce.</li>
				<li class="tweak">IV Drips now give their increased transfer speed to any container that has only blood inside, rather than only IV bags.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Getmore foods are now valued at price = 66% * nutrition value (e.g. SOS Jerky has 6u nutriment, so it costs $60). Syndiecakes remain free.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dan foods are valued at 16.5% * nutrition value. Overall, they became cheaper.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bustanuts remain free, but no longer contain nutriment. A good source of salt and hardcores.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Ramen costs much less than its nutrition value ($15) but has limited stock. Dan ramen is less filling but proportionally cheaper ($2)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cargo Pizza now costs $15 per pizza, so a full pack of five costs $75. (Together, they will provide 150-250 nutriment, a value of ~$2000)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now hack Discount Dan machines to buy antitox pills.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Flour sacks by default now contain 50u flour.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The food processor can butcher toxic meats to carefully remove the toxin sacs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New items containing poison within poisonous meats. Butcher them out!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed bonus poison from cooked poisonous dishes. Meaning if you butcher out the poison from the components, the final result will not be toxic.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Most carp dishes now include pheromones as a bonus</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new alcoholic beverage- Pina Colada</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Firing a pneumatic cannon loaded with food at a person will cause them to take a bite if it hits.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Tea purchased at a machine now comes in one of several thrilling varieties.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hacking a Boozeomat will now unlock coffee and mug options.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Light replacer has been completely overhauled. It now actually contains storage for lights and storage for waste lights, which it automatically picks up. It can be loaded the same way as before or by removing its box and replacing that. It ONLY accepts light bulb/tube boxes. The rest should be self-explanatory from its menu (accessed by clicking it in your hand).</li>
				<li class="tweak">The material costs of most types of lights have been changed slightly. Standard tubes are the same, bulbs are half as much, and the HE variants require three times more glass (but not iron) than their standard counterparts. Also, the large tube and fire bulb were adjusted, but you almost never see them anyway. Even the most expensive light is still a small fraction of a sheet of each, though.</li>
