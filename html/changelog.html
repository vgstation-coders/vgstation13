				<li class="wip">Horror Form for changeling has been added.  Costs 30 points, effectively turns user into a hulk.  Unlike a hulk, however, Horrors can punch people so hard they have a 25% chance of flying down a hallway.  Can also force open doors (50% chance after 5 sec).  Throwing speed bonus.  Takes twice as much fire damage as a normal human.  <u>YOU CANNOT RETURN TO HUMAN FORM AFTER CHANGING INTO A HORROR.</u></li>
