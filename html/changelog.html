In other words, Bags of Holding can now reliably destroy singularities, without blowing yourself up at the same time.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug that caused the Power Gloves's electrical arc to be invisible, and refined its code so the arc looks much nicer.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Reworked projectile pathing and appearance. Projectiles now follow a proper Bresenham path, which means you're less likely to hit something that you didn't intend to hit.</li>

If a bee is above a plant ready for harvest, it'll halve its aging process so it remains alive longer, else it'll accelerate it so it becomes ready for harvest more quickly. It'll also halve the plant's weed and pest spread, and collect some of the plant's toxins for the apiary.
