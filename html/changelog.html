			<h3 class="author">Apogee-dev updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Lightswitches are now turned off by default.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Lightswitches check for players at roundstart and turn on if there are any present.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="soundadd">Added a Funk playlist to the jukebox, courtesy of Dickwrath.</li>
				<li class="soundadd">Added a brand new Shoegaze playlist to the jukebox. With lots of reverb for that big old bar feel.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Revamped the vinyl sprite. The label in the center is still red by default but can be customized for each different playlist.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Player-controlled Giant Spiders now have some sort of color-matrix powered night vision that lets them see quite well in the dark while still being able to identify lit areas, and therefore to seek lights to destroy. Might refine later. Feedback welcome.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Player-controlled Giant Spiders have a brand new HUD, featuring a health indicator, a fire warning, and a zone selection (for choosing which limb to target on humans). Spiderlings also have an indicator for their growth, while Nurse have indicators for both how many eggs they can lay, and how many spiders there are in total, as well as how many are needed before they can evolve into a Queen.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Player-controlled spiderlings are now able to ventcrawl (turns out they couldn&#39;t until now, despite NPC spiderlings being one of the only mob actually having an AI that lets it ventcrawl)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Player-controlled Giant Spiders now have spells for all their abilities that can be cast by players should they end up controlling one. This includes Spiderlings growing up (they get to choose whether to become Guard, Nurse or Hunter), as well as Nurse spinning webs, cocoons, laying eggs, and evolving into queens</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spider hunters are now twice faster, still slower than carps though.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Changed the requirements and logic behind spider nurses evolving into queens. Before nurses would instantly become queens if there were less than 5 queens in the world. Now there has to be at least 10 spiders total (including spiderlings) per queen in the world for an NPC nurse to evolve. It will then have a 10% chance per second to evolve. Player-controlled nurses only require 6 spiders per queen, ensuring that NPC nurses shouldn&#39;t cuck players out of becoming queens. As a side-effect, non-queen nurses will become more common once again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Spider queen projectiles no longer deal 5 brute damage, instead they root mobs to the floor just like blood nails do. As for those, resisting or clicking the webs will let you break out after one or two seconds. The queen can fire her projectile about every three or four seconds at best (BYOND time is uncertain).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the giant spider queen&#39;s projectile being invisible</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed NPC spider nurses laying two egg clusters when they should only be able to lay one, causing them to birth twice as many spiderlings as normal.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Empty Soul Gems can now be fitted into a Construct Shell, turning it into a Shade Beacon. Roaming shades can use the beacon to become a construct without the need for another player to slot them inside the shell, allowing cultists to prepare those in preparation of a fight (because once Act 3 hits no cultist has time to make you a soul gem or a shell, let alone deal with you).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Artificers can now slot Soul Gems (empty or full) in a construct shell if both are adjacent to them, by just clicking on the shell. You can also click the beacon to get the empty gem back.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Artificer health buffed from 50hp to 100hp. They&#39;re now a bit more sturdy than Wraiths (that only have 75hp) but still far from Juggernauts (250hp). This should help them survive more than two seconds once their base is getting broken into, they still suck in direct combat though.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Wraiths can no longer fire bolts that nail mobs down in place.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">This nailing ability has been moved to thrown blood daggers.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Wraith Phase Shift cooldown from 17 seconds to 15 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Wraiths have a new Wraith Tear spell (with 7.5 seconds cooldown) that essentially gives them warping claws ability. Just like with warping claws you can channel the ability by toggling throw mode. The portals created by Wraith Tear only last 3 seconds and do not connect atmospheres, nor create sparks when they close. Non-cultist carbons who pass through them will experience 3 seconds of cult confusion, along with dizziness and other misc. effects. Lastly those portals leave a blood splatter behind them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Wraiths have now learned to write two runes specifically, Path Entrance and Path Exit. Each with a 60 seconds cooldown.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Wraiths damage has been nerfed from 25 brute to 15 brute.</li>
				<li class="experiment">The intent is to have Wraith perform more of a support role directly on the field, unlike Artificers that generally stay in base or Juggernauts that go straight into fights. By having two movement spells Wraiths can more easily get out of danger (they have the lowest HP of all constructs now) While the ability to write down Path Runes makes them a valuable asset to the cult beyond getting rid of a nosy AI.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">New antag role! &#34;Syndicate Challengers&#34;. Roughly based on the old double-agents game mode. Remember to update your preferences to try it out.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Challengers are fairly similar to traitors in that they have an uplink, some TCs, even code words, however their single objective is to assassinate another challenger aboard the station, henceforth there&#39;s always at least 2 of them tasked with killing each others. When there are more than 2 challengers, their assassination orders are chained so that the first one hunts the second one, the second one hunts the third one, etc, until the last one who hunts the first one. Once an assassination has been successfully carried out and reported to the Syndicate, you take on your victim&#39;s target (unless it was you in which case no more objectives are given) and receive 5 additional TCs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">For a successful assassination to be permanently secured by the Syndicate, you must take a photo of your victim&#39;s dead (crit is enough) body, severed head, or brain, and publish it on any newscaster channel for all the crew to see their dead body. You can use any channel, but you may want to use your victim&#39;s ID to create one so as to keep the crew guessing as to your identity, or send the message with another stolen ID to send security on a red herring.</li>
				<li class="experiment">This variant on traitor puts the emphasis on robustness and direct confrontation between traitors, but the Syndicate doesn&#39;t care how the deed is performed so long as the kill is reported. Once it has, your victim&#39;s own assassination objective is forever marked as failed even if they get revived and their target dies later.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Cult conversions have been reworked! Details below.</li>
				<li class="experiment">The sounds produced by conversion runes can now only be heard by those who have a line of sight to the rune.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Automatic boxing now only happens to cult-banned players.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Refusing conversion now restrains you with ghastly bindings that hinders your movements through pain. It takes 1 minute to resist out of those.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Loyalty Implants no longer slow down conversions, but instead force-refuse them.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Setting your cult preferences to Never no longer auto-refuses conversions (you now always get the choice) but still displays your preferences as such to Seer users.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Non-cultists restrained by ghastly bindings show up on the altar&#39;s cult roster, and are valid Blood Magnetism targets (for both summoning and rejoining)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The pain induced by ghastly bindings fades over time, but gets reset when their victim travels through the veil (Path or Blood Magnetism runes)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The cultist who performed the conversion that restrained someone will instantly be informed should the bindings get removed. The bindings also remove themselves should another conversion attempt succeed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cultists no longer resist Loyalty Implanters, instead the implant pops out 10 seconds later.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All loyalty implanted cultists also get informed that they have 10 seconds before their implant pops out when Act 2 begins.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added holy implants. Can be ordered at cargo. Implanted cultists become unable to perform any ritual or use any cult spells. They also become unable to travel through the veil (Path Runes or Blood Magnetism) or be affected by Fervor. However they are destroyed upon conversion so they cannot be used preemptively unlike loyalty implants.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cultists with holy water in their body will also suffer from those impediments.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Cult deconversions are a thing once again 2 years and a half later. They work as such, first have the cultist (or suspected cultist) take a sip of holy water (splashing them from the flask also works, or giving them a holy wafer to eat, etc). Immediately after slap them with a bible on help intent (the target needs to have over 20hp or it won&#39;t work). Everyone can do it, not just chaplains. If the target wasn&#39;t a cultist, nothing unusual happens. Otherwise they will be knockdown and given the choice to abandon the cult or resist. In both cases after 10 seconds, they take 10 brute damage, and a pair of red shades appear. If they accepted the deconversion, those shades will immediately start attacking them, otherwise if they resisted the shades will attack the one who attempted the deconversion, and other nearby non-cultists.</li>
				<li class="experiment">If a chaplain performed the deconversion with a bible of their religion, those red shades have 20hp and deal 5 damage, making them about as much of an inconvenience as blob spores. Otherwise they will be as strong as regular shades.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bibles, Holy Water, Incense, and Thuribles are now available from Cargo as Religious Paraphernelia under Supplies.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cult mobs spawned by bloodstones no longer stand still for a while before attacking non-cultists, they instead immediately give chase once they spawn.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Cultists can now use altars as operating tables with the same efficiency as if they were using an actual operating table. Furthermore, Blood Daggers can now be used as ghetto scalpels and circular saws, and Talismans can be used as ghetto hemostats.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Monkeys, Diona Nymphs, and other primitive carbons are now able to use their health as blood when performing cult rituals, without the need to acquire a syringe and a beaker. Each unit of blood taken translates to 1 oxy damage, which is negligible as long as small amounts are used, but can quickly kill you if if the ritual requires a lot of blood at once (such as resurrect).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Aliens can use their blood as cultists as well by popular request. They cannot hold tomes though so writing full runes require a bit of effort. They take brute damage instead of oxy when writing runes but it&#39;s not like it matters since they heal all damage types over time by just standing over weeds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">As a human cultist, you can now just grab a monkey just like you can grab a human to use their blood. Note that dead monkeys don&#39;t provide any more blood. Yes that means you can give them some Dexalin Plus to keep them as free blood dispensers, but then again so could you all this time when using a syringe and beaker.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Also monkeys now stop wandering around when grabbed with Grab Intent, just like when they&#39;re being pulled.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Constructs could already use runes that don&#39;t require a blood cost, however this limitation has been removed, giving constructs new purpose as a catalyst for low-cost rune rituals, as constructs can now pay the blood cost without having to actually produce any blood. Does this mean rune-drawing constructs down the line? I don&#39;t know. Not for now anyway (and not later without some limitations, Pale Bodies using stun runes is enough of a source of frustration already) We&#39;ll see how this goes first.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Shades can also use runes from now on, but only ones that don&#39;t have a blood cost (unless they find a splatter or bleeding corpse). As a side effect, so can Cult Blades, that can now fly through Path Runes.</li>
