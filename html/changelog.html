		<!-- NOTE TO UPDATERS!! Please only list things which are important to players.
		Stuff which is in development and not yet visible to players or just code related
		(ie. code improvements for expandability, etc.) should not be listed here. They
		should be listed in the changelog upon commit though. Thanks. -->
		<!-- To take advantage of the pretty new format (well it was new when I wrote this anyway), open the "add-to-changelog.html" file in any browser and add the stuff and then generate the html code and paste it here -->
		<!-- Suggestion:  Group changes not merged into master into a single [IN DEVELOPMENT] block, then change the date to today before merging.  Makes the changes from the last release a bit easier to comprehend. -->
