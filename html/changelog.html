			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2021.01.20</h2>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">New antag role! &#34;Syndicate Challengers&#34;. Roughly based on the old double-agents game mode. Remember to update your preferences to try it out.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Challengers are fairly similar to traitors in that they have an uplink, some TCs, even code words, however their single objective is to assassinate another challenger aboard the station, henceforth there&#39;s always at least 2 of them tasked with killing each others. When there are more than 2 challengers, their assassination orders are chained so that the first one hunts the second one, the second one hunts the third one, etc, until the last one who hunts the first one. Once an assassination has been successfully carried out and reported to the Syndicate, you take on your victim&#39;s target (unless it was you in which case no more objectives are given) and receive 5 additional TCs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">For a successful assassination to be permanently secured by the Syndicate, you must take a photo of your victim&#39;s dead (crit is enough) body, severed head, or brain, and publish it on any newscaster channel for all the crew to see their dead body. You can use any channel, but you may want to use your victim&#39;s ID to create one so as to keep the crew guessing as to your identity, or send the message with another stolen ID to send security on a red herring.</li>
				<li class="experiment">This variant on traitor puts the emphasis on robustness and direct confrontation between traitors, but the Syndicate doesn&#39;t care how the deed is performed so long as the kill is reported. Once it has, your victim&#39;s own assassination objective is forever marked as failed even if they get revived and their target dies later.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Cult conversions have been reworked! Details below.</li>
				<li class="experiment">The sounds produced by conversion runes can now only be heard by those who have a line of sight to the rune.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Automatic boxing now only happens to cult-banned players.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Refusing conversion now restrains you with ghastly bindings that hinders your movements through pain. It takes 1 minute to resist out of those.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Loyalty Implants no longer slow down conversions, but instead force-refuse them.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Setting your cult preferences to Never no longer auto-refuses conversions (you now always get the choice) but still displays your preferences as such to Seer users.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Non-cultists restrained by ghastly bindings show up on the altar&#39;s cult roster, and are valid Blood Magnetism targets (for both summoning and rejoining)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The pain induced by ghastly bindings fades over time, but gets reset when their victim travels through the veil (Path or Blood Magnetism runes)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The cultist who performed the conversion that restrained someone will instantly be informed should the bindings get removed. The bindings also remove themselves should another conversion attempt succeed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cultists no longer resist Loyalty Implanters, instead the implant pops out 10 seconds later.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All loyalty implanted cultists also get informed that they have 10 seconds before their implant pops out when Act 2 begins.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added holy implants. Can be ordered at cargo. Implanted cultists become unable to perform any ritual or use any cult spells. They also become unable to travel through the veil (Path Runes or Blood Magnetism) or be affected by Fervor. However they are destroyed upon conversion so they cannot be used preemptively unlike loyalty implants.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cultists with holy water in their body will also suffer from those impediments.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Cult deconversions are a thing once again 2 years and a half later. They work as such, first have the cultist (or suspected cultist) take a sip of holy water (splashing them from the flask also works, or giving them a holy wafer to eat, etc). Immediately after slap them with a bible on help intent (the target needs to have over 20hp or it won&#39;t work). Everyone can do it, not just chaplains. If the target wasn&#39;t a cultist, nothing unusual happens. Otherwise they will be knockdown and given the choice to abandon the cult or resist. In both cases after 10 seconds, they take 10 brute damage, and a pair of red shades appear. If they accepted the deconversion, those shades will immediately start attacking them, otherwise if they resisted the shades will attack the one who attempted the deconversion, and other nearby non-cultists.</li>
				<li class="experiment">If a chaplain performed the deconversion with a bible of their religion, those red shades have 20hp and deal 5 damage, making them about as much of an inconvenience as blob spores. Otherwise they will be as strong as regular shades.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bibles, Holy Water, Incense, and Thuribles are now available from Cargo as Religious Paraphernelia under Supplies.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cult mobs spawned by bloodstones no longer stand still for a while before attacking non-cultists, they instead immediately give chase once they spawn.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Blood Communion tattoo now also gives a small buff to blood regen.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Confusion runes sometimes causing people to remain blinded forever when they time-out.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed deculted players still having cult UI elements on their screen</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed splashing mobs with a holy water flask applying the equivalent of half the flask&#39;s current volume to them instead of only the 5u being spent.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the holy water flask having wrong in-hand sprites when facing some directions.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Using a soulstone on a cultist shade as a non-cultist now properly decults the shade.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">De-culted players now get a message specifying exactly what they remember about the cult, generally only the player who converted them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cultists can now use altars as operating tables with the same efficiency as if they were using an actual operating table. Furthermore, Blood Daggers can now be used as ghetto scalpels and circular saws, and Talismans can be used as ghetto hemostats.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">HarseTheef updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds the changeling vial, stone mask, and the cult pamphlet to the traitor uplink for traitors that want to work together.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cyborg examine text upon death is more useful</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Kurfursten updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

				<li class="rscadd">Fatsos can now wear the default wintercoat, as well as the security and warden versions.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Hard rock walls on Snaxi are now less pointy</li>
				<li class="tweak">Snaxi brig has been overhauled. It&#39;s less chokepointy.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug where random bloodstones could sometimes spawn off station randomly as long as it was still on Z-1 (for example, in the caves on Snaxi or in the Vox outpost on Roid)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There are now vaults to discover on the Snaxi outer reaches.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Converted the old Santa cabin and construction site on Snaxi into random vaults.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Wolves won&#39;t lose nutrition until tamed, and tamed wolves will lose nutrition much slower.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Feral wolves will always attack, whereas pliable wolves are much easier to tame.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Monkeys, Diona Nymphs, and other primitive carbons are now able to use their health as blood when performing cult rituals, without the need to acquire a syringe and a beaker. Each unit of blood taken translates to 1 oxy damage, which is negligible as long as small amounts are used, but can quickly kill you if if the ritual requires a lot of blood at once (such as resurrect).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Aliens can use their blood as cultists as well by popular request. They cannot hold tomes though so writing full runes require a bit of effort. They take brute damage instead of oxy when writing runes but it&#39;s not like it matters since they heal all damage types over time by just standing over weeds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">As a human cultist, you can now just grab a monkey just like you can grab a human to use their blood. Note that dead monkeys don&#39;t provide any more blood. Yes that means you can give them some Dexalin Plus to keep them as free blood dispensers, but then again so could you all this time when using a syringe and beaker.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Also monkeys now stop wandering around when grabbed with Grab Intent, just like when they&#39;re being pulled.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Constructs could already use runes that don&#39;t require a blood cost, however this limitation has been removed, giving constructs new purpose as a catalyst for low-cost rune rituals, as constructs can now pay the blood cost without having to actually produce any blood. Does this mean rune-drawing constructs down the line? I don&#39;t know. Not for now anyway (and not later without some limitations, Pale Bodies using stun runes is enough of a source of frustration already) We&#39;ll see how this goes first.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Shades can also use runes from now on, but only ones that don&#39;t have a blood cost (unless they find a splatter or bleeding corpse). As a side effect, so can Cult Blades, that can now fly through Path Runes.</li>

Departments with already active orders/no population are way less likely to receive new orders.</li>

Shipping items this way won&#39;t grant Cargo a bonus.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Departments that may receive orders will appear on the round end scoreboard in a leaderboard. All that matters to rank up is the money on the department&#39;s account at round end. Any way to increase that number (or reduce the number of other departments) are fair game. Try to have your department reach rank 1!</li>

				<li class="tweak">Tweaked the ambience sounds of the Research Outpost. The Outpost Engineering/Atmos rooms now properly emit the same ambience as those on the station.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Here&#39;s a bunch of Xenoarch and Research Oupost fixes and tweaks</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed analysis trays not having their sprite update when reagents are added or removed from them.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the analysis machines only heating up when idle and not when scanning, regardless of the temperature of the air around them.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the analysis machines heating up at an absurd rate. I removed the cap on entropy so cold air in the pen where the machines are is a lot more efficient at keeping them at working temperatures. The rate at which they heat up now depends on their power consumption which has been reworked for both their idle and active states.</li>
				<li class="experiment">This means however that the machines will overheat if you try to use them at room temperature. From now on when you arrive at the outpost and plan to do triangulation later, remember to turn on the Freezer so the pen has time to cool down. Upgrading the machines with phasic scanning modules or better however will let them complete the scan before they have time to overheat, so that&#39;s an alternative.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The temperature gauge on the machines now goes all the way from 0K to 400K.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Replaced the Nitrogen Pressure Tank with a Plasma Canister on top of a connector port on all maps (I used a Plasma Pressure Tank on maps where the canister couldn&#39;t be reached) which has much better specific heat and thus is much better at keeping the pen cold.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed the extra Air Alarm and vents in the Anomalous Materials Lab pen since it would always trigger alarms if you started cooling. Added a Gas Meter on the floor instead that can be examined from afar to check the pen&#39;s temperature.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the Research Outpost Atmospherics&#39; Gas Mixer taking 80 percent Oxygen and 20 percent Nitrogen instead of the other way around. It&#39;s been like that since forever? jesus christ.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Lots of small changes to the box Research Outpost beside the Anomalous Materials Lab. Removed one of the SMES, a single one is enough to keep the outpost powered for almost 4 hours, and extended the hallway with an airlock on the other side of the transit tube so you can easily set up the solars in the crate next to them, which have been found after testing to keep the outpost powered for up to 11 hours if set up early. Also added a Power Monitoring Computer to the Outpost Power Substation. Lots of other small QoL changes, moves items on tables a bit, added a Newscaster, a Mousecube box, added a pair of Suspension Field Gens to the Temporary storage for old times sake. Replaced the tables with the redundant pickaxe and excavation picks with crates that xenoarchaeologists can use to easily gather their small finds, along with a table on which can be found the new revamped Xenoarchaeology manual.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Said manual, Out on the Dig New Edition! also features a new sprite.</li>

				<li class="imageadd">The depth scanner, digsite locators, core sampler, rock sliver, as well as the solution trays all have new sprites.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The core sampler now works without the need for sample bags, but takes one second to extract a sample. It&#39;s got sounds now too.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can use a pen on a rock sliver to label it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Edited the description of rock slivers, some of the xenoarch-related reagents, as well as the xenoarch sample analysis machines to help players understand each of their purposes.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed the beacon, and locater device from Excavation Tools closets due to their utmost uselessness in regard to the job. The locater (renamed locator) device however can now be acquired from the Protolathe at Bluespace Tech Level 2. It still looks just like the disk pinpointer though.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The xenoarchaeological digsite locator has been buffed to always show digsite material colors (requires Anomaly Tech Level 3)</li>
				<li class="tweak">The advanced xenoarchaeological digsite locator has been buffed to also highlight turfs with buried large artifacts (requires Anomaly Tech Level 4)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Alden-Saraspova Counter is FINALLY available from RnD, barely 4 years after I added the fucking tech tree, and gives you the distance to the closest Large Artifact. You can also fit them in your excavation belt (requires Anomaly Tech Level 5)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Hard Disk Drives. As useless as Corrupted Data Disks, and both may now be found in maint loot spawners</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Encrypted HDD (Anomaly Tech 5), now spawned by Anomaly Analysers when a large artifact gets analyzed for the first time. Replaces that anomaly tech data that used to be in the Anomaly Report. Deconstructing one of those is enough to get the advanced xenoarchaeological digsite locator which will highlight buried large artifacts.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The distance to the nearest artifact given by the Fourier transform spectroscope is a lot more reliable now that it counts distance in a circle rather than a square.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can slap Artifact Analysis reports onto Anomaly Containers, allowing people who examine the container to read the report.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Anomaly Containers are now access restricted to science. You can break them open still using an emag, guns, or explosions.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Anomaly Containers have a slightly different appearance when containing a large artifact, or when broken.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Placing a Large Artifact into an anomaly container automatically toggles off its effects.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Large Artifacts that have both been analyzed and had their primary effect activated at least once now add points to the crew score (wow, scientists can finally contribute to the crew score lol)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You once again have a very small chance of finding a Syndicate Beacon instead of a Large Artifact in Xenoarch. You can use it to become a traitor, but the beacon will explode after a short delay if you were already part of another faction, or antag banned.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Unlike the old Syndicate Beacon, it can be re-used, but subsequent traitorifications will require admin approval, so you&#39;ll be able to write a cover letter to the Syndicate for why they should hire you. If you bother admins too much, they will detonate the beacon.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">The Syndicate Beacon now has its own sprite that looks a bit like a laptop, separating it for good from the wish granter.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Since I was confused at first between the Syndicate Beacon and the Singularity Beacon, I judged a good idea to have a regular non-syndicate Singularity Beacon spawn as well among the large finds. It has the same rarity as a large Supermatter Crystal, given its round-ending potential.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Upped the rarity of Construct Shells so they&#39;re more common than the round ending items.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a few large artifacts such as the Warping Claws, the Essence Printer and the Communication Crystal being deemed mundane by the Anomaly Analyzer.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A new edition of the Out on the Dig manual is out! Now with information actually relevant to the job of xenoarchaeology!</li>
