			<h3 class="author">9600bauds updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Trying to clone a husk now provides a more informative error message, rather than the generic 'mental interface failure'. This message also tells you if the dead guy can still rejoin their corpse, so you can try to clone a husk before attempting a head transplant and know you're not wasting your time on someone that already logged out.</li>
				<li class="spellcheck">Updated the in-game 'Cloning techniques of the 26th Century' book that spawns in Genetics so that it's not outdated by several years.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added pill color selection directly into the main menu of ChemMasters, to make it more convenient to switch pill colors.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">ChemMasters will now remember the last amount of pills and bottles created, making that the default input.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Some optimization that should hopefully fix ChemMasters taking a little while to open their window when used for the first time in the round.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="author">9600bauds updated:</h3>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added pop out cakes - enormous cakes that are big enough for a human to hide inside. Inside of it is a one use party string - pull it to sound the party horns and graciously climb out of the cake. Cutting them with a knife produces edible slices.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pop out cakes can be bought for 3 telecrystals by nuclear operatives, or cooked in the microwave using 15 milk, 45 flour, 6 eggs and 6 sheets of cardboard.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">mph55 updated:</h3>

				<li class="rscadd">Trying to put a brain in a MMI now produces a special message telling you to try again if the brain has ghosted but can still rejoin their body, much like how cloners work with corpses. When this happens, the ghosted player will get bwoinked and told to rejoin their corpse.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the message you get when examining a brain, which was supposed to differentiate brains with a player still inside and brains belonging to a ghosted player.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Diona nymphs not regenerating health from bright lights. Note that their health regen is much much slower than grown Diona. Did not 'fix' the way they take damage from darkness, meaning they still pretty much just don't.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Blobs now emit a cloud of purple smoke over whatever they are affecting. So now you get a clear visual feedback when someone gets attacked by them, or they destroy something (wall or item).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Huge revamp of the blob's visuals. Blobs now support two kind of looks. classic ones (made from 32x32 dmi) and new ones (made from 64x64 dmi)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new looks feature added overlays, animations, such as connections between the blobs, or various feedback animations (normal blob transmitting a pulse, factory producing a mob, resource producing a point, etc)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new looks also features a damage overlay, letting you know approximately how much health the blob part has. In the classic look, only the normal blobs have a damaged sprite.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When a new blob gets created (through game mode, random event, or admin spawning), the overmind player gets to choose the blob's looks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Admins can set the looks of every blobs in the world by the push of a new button under the Fun tab.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Resource blobs now look darker if the overmind they were connected to has died. Other overminds can hover near it to take ownership of them and re-activate them.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Overminds are now immune to singularities, their pull, and Nar-Sie.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When a blob gets pulsed, it will now hurt any mob standing on their tile. Telescience teleporting you right next to the core so you can destroy it without any danger is no longer a viable strategy, unless you have a really good armor, a really powerful gun, and even then it will require some testing.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Blobs cannot destroy docking ports anymore.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The Blob Overmind's HUD now properly indicates how much health his core has.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a lot of messages to Blob Overminds that trigger under a variety of conditions. Such as blobs near their core dying, a special blob that they've placed having been destroyed, or their core getting damaged.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If there are multiple Blob Overminds in the world, they get instantly notified by the death of one of them. They also get notified by the death of any blob core, whether it had an overmind or not.</li>
