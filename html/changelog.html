The former is like a medium intensity meteor shower, sending a handful of blobs and node blobs at the station (about as rare as Communications Blackout). The later is a high intensity meteor storm, sending blobs, node blobs, and a few blob cores (I had 2-3 cores per showers during testing. This one is much rarer, one of the rarest events in fact, along with alien infestation and electrical storm). Both events can only trigger after 30 minutes have elapsed.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Blobs now emit a cloud of purple smoke over whatever they are affecting. So now you get a clear visual feedback when someone gets attacked by them, or they destroy something (wall or item).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Huge revamp of the blob's visuals. Blobs now support two kind of looks. classic ones (made from 32x32 dmi) and new ones (made from 64x64 dmi)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new looks feature added overlays, animations, such as connections between the blobs, or various feedback animations (normal blob transmitting a pulse, factory producing a mob, resource producing a point, etc)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new looks also features a damage overlay, letting you know approximately how much health the blob part has. In the classic look, only the normal blobs have a damaged sprite.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When a new blob gets created (through game mode, random event, or admin spawning), the overmind player gets to choose the blob's looks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Admins can set the looks of every blobs in the world by the push of a new button under the Fun tab.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Resource blobs now look darker if the overmind they were connected to has died. Other overminds can hover near it to take ownership of them and re-activate them.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Overminds are now immune to singularities, their pull, and Nar-Sie.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When a blob gets pulsed, it will now hurt any mob standing on their tile. Telescience teleporting you right next to the core so you can destroy it without any danger is no longer a viable strategy, unless you have a really good armor, a really powerful gun, and even then it will require some testing.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Blobs cannot destroy docking ports anymore.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The Blob Overmind's HUD now properly indicates how much health his core has.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a lot of messages to Blob Overminds that trigger under a variety of conditions. Such as blobs near their core dying, a special blob that they've placed having been destroyed, or their core getting damaged.</li>

Incidentally this means that xenobio will be able to create real xenos if they manage to gold slime an alien queen into existence!</li>
