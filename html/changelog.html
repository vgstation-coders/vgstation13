				<li class="experiment">The Paint &amp; Linen Update is here! A world of acrylic, fabric, and glue opens before you.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Detailed changelog here: `https://github.com/vgstation-coders/vgstation13/pull/35451`</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Reworked from scratch how paint mixes and interact with floors, walls, and everything in general. You can craft acrylic paint in Chemistry by first mixing glue, and then adding some pigments.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Glue is a new (previously unused) reagent that applies to object the same effect that school glue applies, but for only a minute. Can be washed off with water. Creates splatters on the floor that slow down mobs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can use Paint Rollers from Art Vendors to paint floors and walls without consuming reagents, and painting only parts of a tile.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Paint Remover has been reworked into Acetone, and can be obtained either from the Art Vendor, or brewed in Chemistry.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new Vox Trader bundle: the Nano Painter&#39;s toolbox. Nano Paint when applied over a whole tile will cause it to emit its own light. When used on canvas the parts painted with it will glow in the dark.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Nano Paint may also be crafted in Xenobiology by adding Phazon to a Pyrite Slime.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new Botany plant, Flax, whose product can be either grinded for Flax Oil which is a type of paint that partially matches the color of its surrounding reagents (pouring the mixture between two beakers a few times will cause the flax oil to match the other reagents&#39; color completely). Flax may also be processed into cloth using either a Spinning Wheel crafted out of Wood, or an Electric Loom produced by R&amp;D.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cloth can now be used to craft some simple items by hand, or more intricate clothing by using Knitting Needles crafted out of wood, or a Sewing Machine produced by R&amp;D.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">After adding some pigments inside a cauldron, you can dye crafted items in it either fully, or partially depending on the item. Bedsheets can be dyed as well.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Using Knitting Needles or a Sewing Machine, you can toggle the appearance of bedsheets between their old plaid look and their new wider look.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">R&amp;D may also now print the High Roller, a large paint roller that lets you easily and efficiently apply reagents over a large area. This applies to paint, but also bleach, acetone, lube, everything you can think of. If the reagent is a pigment, it will cover floors like paint does.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Re-Sprited Painting Brushes, Palettes, Paint Buckets, and added in-hand icons for all.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Metal Buckets similar to Paint Buckets can now be crafted from metal sheets.</li>
				<li class="tweak">the old Bucket is now called Plastic Bucket, and can be crafted from Plastic, or from the Biogenerator.</li>
				<li class="tweak">the Colorful Syndrome disease effect has been reworked, and now splatters the surroundings of the infected mob with paint instead of using chem smoke.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now toggle hoods on mannequins or other players by using the stripping menu.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some machines now automatically appear higher when built on top of tables, or when tables are placed below them, and return to their default offset when the table is removed or flipped.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Implemented a new subsystem that revamps the way reagent containers normalize their temperature in relation to the environment. This new method makes reagents reach room temperature quite faster on average (except when using a Stasis Beaker), and has been finely adjusted so temperature changes are more noticeable while also feeling realistic. You can Alt Middle click a beaker or food item to blow some air on them and accelerate the process. As an added bonus, this system consumes a negligible amount of CPU compared to the one in effect until now, and is much simpler to read and adjust, thus more maintainable.</li>

				<li class="imageadd">Solar Panels are no longer visually constrained to 8 directions, and can be observed rotating in real time.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Solar Panels can now generate powers even if they aren&#39;t connected to a Solar Panel Control computer.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Players can now use a wrench on Solar Panels to change their rotation manually. Rotating them this way is faster than doing it from a computer, but you need to remain adjacent until the rotation is over or it will be incomplete.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Solar Panels are now affected by EMPs, which cause them to spin to a random orientation. They will re-calibrate themselves on their own as long as they are connected to a working Solar Panel Control computer.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Solar Panels now feature visual cracks when they&#39;ve taken some damage, but not enough to break them. Since damage reduces their power output, this lets you identify at a glance which panels need repairs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Attacking a Solar Panel with a weapon now gives visual and textual feedback</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Solar Panels not emitting any power in some cases despite them being nearly aligned with the sun.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Solar Trackers now actually need line of sight to the star to provide its angle. Despite them iconically being mapped at the extremity of solar arrays, you could just build them inside the station.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Solar Trackers now have a broken sprite. While broken, they cannot be used by Solar Panel Control computers to automatically track the star. They also now more clearly indicate the current star&#39;s rotation as long as they have sight of it, while a solar tracker without view of a star will appear noticeable darker.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Catwalks have had their cost reduced from 3 metal rods to just 2 (both including the 1 rod lattice cost). Their construction time has also been halved.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You no longer have a chance to slip when walking on catwalks.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed an edge case where placing cables in space didn&#39;t check for proper support.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Player-controlled mice now visibly rest.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Rapid Cable Layer (RCL) has been rewritten from scratch and is now much easier to use and less prone to accidentally placing unwanted wire knots. You can click adjacent tiles directly to create a pair of wires that connects both that tile and yours (and that tries to connect to existing nodes on both tiles even if you didn&#39;t pixel-perfect clicked them). Placing wires this way, or clicking the RCL enables its active mode, during which you can lay wires by just walking around. Unlike previously the RCL won&#39;t attempt to place extra nodes on tiles that already have wires connecting from the same direction, but you can still force that behaviour when clicking tiles. Clicking the RCL again disables it.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug where the target that was initially hit by the wizard&#39;s &#34;Lightning&#34; spell would randomly cause the Lightning spell to not arc to nearby targets and randomly hit the same target twice. The Lightning spell will now properly arc to other targets and not have a random chance to instantly put someone into critical condition while at it.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The wizard that casts the &#39;Lightning&#34; spell will no longer be a valid target to be dealt damage to, which was caused by the Lightning spell arcing to a target that the wizard was in the way of. However, it will still arc off the wizard if it is able to do so.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug that caused Pain Mirror to be able to indefinitely ping-pong between different Pain Mirror users, provided that they were not human. This was, most notably, possible with the wizard&#39;s Arcane Golems.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug where a max-power vampire using the Screech ability would get a backlash from every single nearby null rod wearer rather than just one. This also means the Screech ability will be properly stopped and blocked rather than still affecting everyone in the vicinity.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Null rods carried by people with ear protection will now properly cause a backlash against max-power vampires using the Screech ability instead of doing nothing.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Reduced the amount of jittering caused by the vampire&#39;s Screech ability from 5 minutes to 40 seconds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The vampire&#39;s Screech ability can be used at any time, rather than only when there are living targets nearby.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Failing to Enthrall someone as a vampire will no longer put the ability on cooldown.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Failing to Hypnotise someone as a vampire, whether because they are blind or for other reasons, will no longer put the ability on cooldown.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Vampire abilities that get backlashed by null rods will now go on cooldown. This also fixed a bug where the max-power vampire&#39;s Glare ability could be spammed non-stop.</li>
				<li class="spellcheck">Fixed a tiny typo regarding the message that a vampire receives when a null rod causes a backlash.</li>
