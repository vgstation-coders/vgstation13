				<li class="rscadd">Chaplains who adhere to the Belmont religion now spawn with a box containing clothing reminiscent of Richter Belmont, and a flask of Sacred Water in their pocket. They can also throw their bible to hit people around them with it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Sacred Water is a new reagent that turns Holy Water into more of itself when in contact with it. When splashed on a floor, it creates sacred flames that only burn the unholy (that is, vampires, cultists, and any other supernatural creature)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Players may now forge a Battle Cross out of silver at an anvil. Battle Crosses are basically boomerangs that deal bonus damage to supernatural creatures, but they only return to the hands of those of the Belmont religion.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Boomerangs have been rewritten from scratch and now behave more like you would expect from a boomerang in a video game. They are now a lot more reliable so their damage has been lowered from 16 to 10, but they still feel really strong so I&#39;m looking forward to feedback by players who have been on both ends of a boomerang throw.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Boomerangs have also gotten a re-sprite.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Unnecessary close and refresh buttons have now been removed from the UIs of timers, proximity sensors, infrared sensors and light tile remotes as these functions happen normally now.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="date">2024.08.31</h2>
			<h3 class="author">DeityLink updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">The Floral Somatoray has been refactored and should now behave more as you might expect. You can use it on trays both at range and adjacently, although if someone is standing in-between they might get hit instead.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can once again change the brute damage of bees by using the Floral Somatoray on apiaries while it&#39;s set to Morphology, while Development controls the yield. There are plans to allow further genetic alterations of bees in the future.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now use a solder to &#34;un-emag&#34; a floral somatoray.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">The Floral Somatoray has had a sprite pass with its appearance depending on its currently selected mode. The rays it fire also change color based on the selected mode.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Moody Lights have been added to all airlocks, firelocks, and blast doors.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed christmas lights now actually emitting any light. Their lit up sprite also now appears over darkness.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed snow tiles not regenerating snow like they should sometimes.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed each snow tile and christmas light having a duplicate on top of them.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reworked the way snow tiles hold snow so instead of losing snow from the duplicate tile you get even more! Each tile now has 10 snow which it regenerates by one every 30 seconds. You can grab 1 snow by hand, or 3 at a time by shovel. If the tile reaches 0 snow it disappears.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Re-added the grabbed and digged snow tile sprites so you can easily see whether a tile is full of snow, or whether it&#39;s one shovel hit away from disappearing.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Coinboxes can now come out of vending machines again.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Coinboxes and vendpacks now eject from crowbar destroying vending machines. Vendpacks still require inserted cardboard for this.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Coinboxes can now be recycled for metal, under the electronics category.</li>
				<li class="tweak">To compensate coinboxes being recyclable, and as to not be an infinite metal source, they are now required in their frame build step. A no access requirement version of them can be built as a metal stack recipe to aid this.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Mech syringe guns now actually fire their syringes properly, making them finally useful for something other than getting fast research done.</li>

				<li class="imageadd">Apiaries have new sprites to commemorate their graduation from being tray-bound.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Apiary kits now have in-hand icons.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You no longer need a hatchet to harvest an apiary and can now do so bare-handed. Doing it this way no longer deconstructs the apiary so you can just calm the bees and let them return to it on their own. Hatchets (or alternatively crowbars) are still required to deconstruct them, which still also harvests them at the same time if they contain honey.</li>
				<li class="soundadd">Added sounds for building/deconstructing apiaries, and for pouring BeezEz in them.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">The following changes have been done to the Rampant Brand Intelligence event. The original infected vending machine is now guaranteed to emit one of its custom slogans when it infects another vending machine, making players more likely to find it (and to hear those slogans at all like jesus christ the odds were ridiculously low). When the event ends, ALL infected machines stop throwing items instead of only 90 percent, and their speakers now return to their previous value instead of always being deactivated.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Metatable Mutagen, a sibling to Metastable Mutagen that does the same, but it will also randomly transform into any of the other tables in the game if sprayed onto them. Made with equal parts Untable Mutagen (the botany version) and Charcoal, with 5u Enzyme as a catalyst.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added Moody Lights to Hydroponic trays. This concerns not only their warning lights, but also the tray&#39;s own light toggle which lights up the plant quite nicely in the dark, and the plant&#39;s own bioluminescence. Plant may have custom moody light overlays, but ones that don&#39;t just glow all over if the bioluminescent gene is spliced into them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Alt-Click on Hydroponic trays now brings up a radial menu to quickly toggle its light, its lid, or set its label.</li>

				<li class="imageadd">Hydroponic Trays now have a different sprite when they are un-anchored.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Hydroponic Trays now have a visible vent when wrenched on top of a connector.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some more the way Hydroponic Trays transfer gas when connected to a pipenet, or when their lid is open in general. You may now even use them as slow, one-way, passive vents.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Newly built hydroponic trays now require you to fill them with water.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now build plastic hydroponic trays! Easy to build, but just like with soil it won&#39;t provide you with any of the sensor data.</li>

				<li class="experiment">The Cult Eclipse Update is here!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cultists have a new UI Panel that enables easier tracking of the cult&#39;s members, their objectives, and lots of other important information.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">As cultists perform occult activities and complete objectives, they generate devotion which both grants them Tattoos imbued with new powers, but also quickens the arrival of the new Eclipse event.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">During the Eclipse, all lights aboard the station are dimmed, highly reducing visibility. The cult can use the new (very old in fact) Tear Reality rune during the eclipse to start a ritual that can let them end the round. If the Eclipse ends without the ritual being attempted, the crew will be safe from Nar-Sie for this round.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If the cult attempts to raise Nar-Sie, they will have to defend a Blood Stone for a certain amount of time, and from that point onward all cultists will have a visible halo betraying their appearance to the crew. If the Blood Stone is destroyed, the ritual will end, and the cult will receive various handicaps, such has the halo remaining visible, and the cultist cap falling to zero.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Scoreboard now lists cultists in order of how much devotion they generated. The cult now &#34;wins&#34; or &#34;loses&#34; following various conditions, each with a different message on the scoreboard. A cult that couldn&#39;t raise Nar-Sie can still get a victory by having some of its members escape alive and free aboard the shuttle.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Eclipse event also has a small chance to occur during non-cult rounds, keeping some uncertainty around until actual occult shit is witnessed.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Blob: Blobs will now ignore half of a target&#39;s armor value when calculating damage. Some of the defensive values would lead to absurd amounts of protection against the blob.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Blob: Strong blob tiles now have 50 health, down from 75, which means less hits are required to destroy them (3 Liberator/Antique Laser Gun shots, 4 regular laser shots, down from 4 and 5-6 respectively).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Blob: Blob tiles now have a 50% chance to successfully spread into space instead of 25%. Useful, as the midround blob comes from outer space.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Blob: Resource blobs now cost 10 points instead of 30 points, meaning they will make a return on their investment after 1 minute and 20 seconds at earliest instead of 4 minutes.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Blob: Liberator laser gun shots will now deal 25 damage to blobs instead of 40, which is the default for anything that isn&#39;t humanoid, and deal half of their damage to a nearby blob tile on hit, which means a Liberator shot can destroy a blob tile and damage another in one shot rather than destroy two blob tiles. Fire in a formation!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blob: Midround blobs can now influence the round&#39;s episode name.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Auto-ignition mechanics from air temperature has been disabled, and will now require previous conventional sources of being set on fire in order to be on fire.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Items on fire will no longer produce temperatures by themselves. However, the fires they may produce, such as pie tins in contact with sparks, still will.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Action buttons now have a tiny click delay before they can be clicked again, preventing instances of extreme spam.</li>

Crew-members can use those to warm up their food items after coming out of a snow storm. (The food items would reach room temperature quickly on their own anyway, but this is a pretty pro-immulsions way to do it)</li>
