Destroying a Living Mannequin drop their items. If the mannequin was holding a highly damaging item when it woke up, it'll fight using that item. It doesn't have the dexterity to fire guns however.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Trying to clone a husk now provides a more informative error message, rather than the generic 'mental interface failure'.
