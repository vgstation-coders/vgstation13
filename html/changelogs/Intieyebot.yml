- rscadd: "New borg sprites, meet the eyebot."
- tweak: "The list where you choose your borg sprite is now alphabetized. Did the MoMMi one too while I was at it."
- tweak: "You now get 8 tries to pick your borg sprite, up from 6. This system will hopefully be replaced by a menu where you see previews of the borgs."
