changes: 
- rscadd: Added a new antagonist: the grue; a creature that lurks in the dark and eats you if you aren't too careful.
- rscadd: Grues thrive in the dark and abhor bright lights. They heal and move faster in the dark and get burned in bright light.
- rscadd: Grues have four life stages: egg, larva, juvenile, and adult.
- rscadd: Adult grues can eat people whole, and doing so makes them more powerful each time. Beware the snowball effect.
- rscadd: Grues are particularly vulnerable while moulting into a new life stage.
- rscadd: Egg laying can be toggled as a config option.
- rscadd: Meat and gibs can be recolored without having to add custom meat sprites for each mob.
- bugfix: Slime puddles can now be put into cloners and scanned properly.
- tweak: Renamed humanoid grue to umbra.
