changes: 
- experiment: Rehauled the R-UST to make it feature-complete.
- rscadd: The EM Field now powers rad collectors and radiates mobs.
- rscadd: The EM Field must now also be kept under 100 million degrees Kelvin lest it shutdown from overheating.
- rscadd: The Core Monitor will now display the field's radiation and temperature levels.
- rscdel: Removed the Fuel Assembly port. Fuel Assemblies should now be inserted directly into the injector.
- rscadd: Added the R-UST computer boards as a crate that can be ordered from Cargo.
- tweak: Fixed construction on several R-UST parts. All the parts can now be built by Science or Mechanics.
- tweak: Fuel Injectors now need to be linked to the Fuel Monitor via multitool.
- rscadd: Overheating the EM Field can result in events that will bring the round to an end if done in a specific matter.
