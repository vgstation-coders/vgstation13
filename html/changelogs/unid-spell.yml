changes: 
- rscadd: "Added a new wizard spell: Forge Arcane Golem. Cooldown - 20 seconds (purchasing the cooldown upgrade lowers it to 1 second). When cast, you will create a magical golem and infuse it with your mana and knowledge. The golem will possess basic, unupgraded versions of every spell you know."
- rscadd: "Forge Arcane Golem and Mind Transfer can't be learned by golems."
- rscadd: "Whenever you cast a spell, all of your arcane golems will cast it too. Targeted spells are cast at the same target. Golems ignore spell cooldowns, and can cast spells as often as their master can."
- rscadd: "Only 1 golem can exist at once. This limit may be raised by 1 by upgrading the spell, up to 2 times (for a maximum of 3 golems). Casting the spell when too many golems already exist will teleport all of your golems to you instead."
- rscadd: "Arcane golems permanently follow you, are slow, have 50 health and can't attack. When a golem dies, all of its masters' spells go on cooldown as if they were cast."
