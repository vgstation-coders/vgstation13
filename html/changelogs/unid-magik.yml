changes: 
- rscadd: You can now upgrade spell power of Summon Robes. Upgrading it makes the spell summon a gem encrusted hardsuit.
- rscadd: You can now upgrade spell power of Shoe Snatching Charm. Upgrading it makes the spell summon 4 glass shards around the victim whenever it successfully removes shoes (meaning no glass is summoned if the victim had no shoes).
- rscadd: You can now upgrade spell power of Fireball. Upgrading it makes fireball targettable, shooting it wherever you click.
- tweak: Several spells are now controlled by clicking on the spell and then on the target, instead of choosing a target randomly or bringing up a menu. Among these spells are Arse Nath, Clown/Mime/Horse curses, Blind, Shoe Snatching Charm, Subjugate and Controlled Fireball.
