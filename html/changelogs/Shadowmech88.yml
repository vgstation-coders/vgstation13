- tweak: Adamantine golems are now a proper race instead of humans in suits. They do not breathe, have no blood, are immune to burn damage, are unaffected by temperature extremes, and are immune to low pressure. They also cannot fire guns, cannot wear gloves, shoes, masks or exosuits, can only wear jumpsuits that fit obese people, and the breaking of a golem's limb results in complete detachment of it.
