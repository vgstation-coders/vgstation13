changes: 
  - tweak: The damage spears deal is now affected by the force of the shard used to create it
  - tweak: Creation of a spear now takes some time, and can be interrupted
  - tweak: Slightly changed how sharpening a glass shard affects its force - this also makes sharpened plasma shards be more robust than ordinary glass shards.
