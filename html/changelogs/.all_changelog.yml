  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added 3 microwaves to Snaxi. One in the Escape hallway, one in front of
      Medbay, and one in front of the Bar. Crew-members can use those to warm up their
      food items after coming out of a snow storm. (The food items would reach room
      temperature quickly on their own anyway, but this is a pretty pro-immulsions
      way to do it)
  RealestEstate:
  - rscadd: PAI can uninstall software to make room for others. The process takes
      some time and must complete before the RAM can be refunded.

  - tweak: Food and reagents in your hands and backpack no longer freeze while in
      space. They may be allowed to freeze by dropping them directly onto a space
      turf still. In more general terms, held items and ones in containers now experience
      reduced or no entropy in low pressure environments.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: The Phazon-Nothing reaction now costs 1u of phazon and 1u of Nothing to
      make, and gives 5u of reagent in return. It now requires 5u of Mutagen and 5u
      of Enzyme as catalysts instead of 10 of each.

  - rscdel: 'Blob: Blobs can no longer appear at roundstart.'
  - rscadd: 'Blob: Manual blob expansion no longer has a 75% chance to fail when expanding
      into space, which would waste the chemicals in the process.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Midround blobs now produce twice as many chemicals per second (2
      -> 4).'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Manual blob expansion now costs 5 chemicals instead of 15.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Blobs now deal 50% brute damage and 50% burn damage when attacking.
      Stock up on that burn medication, and diona beware!'
  - rscadd: 'Blob: Blobs will now ignore half of a target''s armor value when calculating
      damage. Some of the defensive values would lead to absurd amounts of protection
      against the blob.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Strong blob tiles now have 50 health, down from 75, which means
      less hits are required to destroy them (3 Liberator/Antique Laser Gun shots,
      4 regular laser shots, down from 4 and 5-6 respectively).'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Blob tiles now have a 50% chance to successfully spread into space
      instead of 25%. Useful, as the midround blob comes from outer space.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Resource blobs now cost 10 points instead of 30 points, meaning
      they will make a return on their investment after 1 minute and 20 seconds at
      earliest instead of 4 minutes.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Liberator laser gun shots will now deal 25 damage to blobs instead
      of 40, which is the default for anything that isn''t humanoid, and deal half
      of their damage to a nearby blob tile on hit, which means a Liberator shot can
      destroy a blob tile and damage another in one shot rather than destroy two blob
      tiles. Fire in a formation!'
  - rscadd: 'Blob: Midround blobs can now influence the round''s episode name.'
  - rscdel: Auto-ignition mechanics from air temperature has been disabled, and will
      now require previous conventional sources of being set on fire in order to be
      on fire.

      spellbooks.

      when the wizard transformed into something else, meaning that they would be
      able to use guns.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where artifacts that could be purchased only one time could
      be repurchased again after buying the wizard's spellbook bundle or after summoning
      magic, which also fixes an exploit where it was possible to infinitely buy Summon
      Magic as long as the wizard bought No Gun Allowed after every cast.
  - bugfix: 'The "No Clothes" passive will no longer say it has "Range: 7", but instead
      "Range: Self".'

  - bugfix: Fixed a nearly 5 years old bug where Fireball could be used while pacified.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where it was impossible to buy Fireball after buying Fire
      Breath. Fire Breath is now its own independent spell, and the way the spellbook
      searches for known spells in a player's mind has been changed to fix the edge-case
      bug where buying a sub-type of a spell would prevent that spell from being purchased.
  - bugfix: Targeting someone directly with Pacify will now cast the spell at their
      location.

  - rscadd: Bioballistic Delivery System now has a multi-splice option which allows

      with the number of splices so a large amount of splices will take longer to
      complete.

  - bugfix: Fixed the Mutate spell immediately ending early if the wizard had the
      Hulk gene.

      at the round-end scoreboard rather than every single spell and spell-like ability
      they know.
  - bugfix: Attempting to use Mind Transfer on a target that is already preparing

      the spell) should no longer break Mind Transfer so hard that it creates a living

      themselves with shields when attacked by creatures.
  - rscadd: Vampires can now see details about how much blood their targets have and
      whether they can be sucked. However, they won't see if someone is a vampire
      or a thrall. Chaplains and people that possess null rods will block this effect.
  - rscadd: The "Sleight of Teeth" vampire ability has been improved; It will no longer
      take an initial 30 seconds before starting the process, it will not inform the
      victim nor any nearby target of the blood sucking and it will not deal 1 brute
      damage compared to regular blood-sucking. Dine and dash today!

  - bugfix: Fixes plants consuming more or less water/toxin/nutriment than they should
      due to rounding.
  - bugfix: In the event of the plant glowing white, the plant analyzer will now say

      cargo. It has a number of reactions with various gases, most importantly that
      it dissipates in the presence of plasma, but consumes a lot of heat in the process
      (making everything cold!).

  DeityLink:
  - experiment: The Cult Eclipse Update is here!
  - rscadd: Cultists have a new UI Panel that enables easier tracking of the cult's
      members, their objectives, and lots of other important information.
  - rscadd: As cultists perform occult activities and complete objectives, they generate
      devotion which both grants them Tattoos imbued with new powers, but also quickens
      the arrival of the new Eclipse event.
  - rscadd: During the Eclipse, all lights aboard the station are dimmed, highly reducing
      visibility. The cult can use the new (very old in fact) Tear Reality rune during
      the eclipse to start a ritual that can let them end the round. If the Eclipse
      ends without the ritual being attempted, the crew will be safe from Nar-Sie
      for this round.
  - rscadd: If the cult attempts to raise Nar-Sie, they will have to defend a Blood
      Stone for a certain amount of time, and from that point onward all cultists
      will have a visible halo betraying their appearance to the crew. If the Blood
      Stone is destroyed, the ritual will end, and the cult will receive various handicaps,
      such has the halo remaining visible, and the cultist cap falling to zero.
  - rscadd: The Scoreboard now lists cultists in order of how much devotion they generated.
      The cult now "wins" or "loses" following various conditions, each with a different
      message on the scoreboard. A cult that couldn't raise Nar-Sie can still get
      a victory by having some of its members escape alive and free aboard the shuttle.
  - rscadd: The Eclipse event also has a small chance to occur during non-cult rounds,
      keeping some uncertainty around until actual occult shit is witnessed.

  SECBATON-GRIFFON:

  - tweak: Edited cryotheum-plasma reaction so that it's more efficient at cooling

      increases (the same amount of cryotheum is consumed in the reaction no matter
      the temperature, only the cooling power is affected).
  nervere:
  - bugfix: Added a client verb, found in the OOC tab, called Check-My-BYOND-Version.
      This verb shows your current major and minor version, along with a link to find
      BYOND builds compatible with the server's current version.

      Well Gun.
  - tweak: A new announcement now appears following Nar-Sie's rise that warns the
      crew that a special emergency shuttle was dispatched. This shuttle arrives at
      the station after a minute, stays for a minute, and returns to Centcomm in just
      a minute. So the round now ends only 3 minutes after the cult's victory.
  - tweak: Halved the time that cultists must spend dancing around the Tear Reality
      rune before the Blood Stone gets raised.

      endgame, with a slightly re-lifted appearance in line with the other cult constructs.
      Cultists that have died may respawn as Harvester constructs as many time as
      they want for the few minutes until the round ends by just getting close to
      Nar-Sie. As back then they can disintegrate nearby doors, spot mobs through

      creates a non-cultist shade bound to its master. You can ultimately bypass the
      cap by using the Reincarnation rune to put the shade in a new human body as
      a cultist, if you go the extra mile.

      to absorb non-wizardly spells.
2024-06-26:
  Eneocho:
  - bugfix: Dexalin and Dexplus should be cyan as intended (instead of orange).
  - rscadd: Chocolate cows can be purchased from cargo for 45c, and can be milked
      for delicious chocolate milk.
  - rscadd: Chocolate milk, made the same way as Hot Coco is (5 parts milk 1 part
      coco) but without heating, and requires a starter sample of chocolate milk as
      a catalyst. Alternatively, can be milked from the aforementioned cows.
  - tweak: "Chocolate milk can be turned into hot coco by heating it to 60\xB0C."
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:

2024-07-09:
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Martians will now properly block projectile effects using their shields.
  - bugfix: Fixed a few instances in the code where having full protection against
      a projectile attack would still cause projectile effects to happen, even when
      it should be completely blocked.
  - bugfix: Fixed a 5-year-old bug where silicons were unintentionally subjected to
      various projectile effects such as syringes from syringe guns. However, they
      have retained their weakness to slowdown caused by tasers.
  - bugfix: Force Wall will now only pick one character on its turf to deal damage
      to if it is impacted by a projectile, as opposed to affecting every single character,
      and will now respect whether the user could block the attack or not.
  falcon2346:
  - tweak: Vegans can now eat walking vegetables.
2024-07-15:
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - rscadd: The laser pistol and laser rifle from R&D now have extremely poor accuracy
      during April Fools.

      weapon accuracy.

      entity they've hit.
  - bugfix: (ApotheoticOrder provided the fix) Fixed the Lightning effects such as
      from the wizard's spell or the traitor's power gloves, the sprites will now
      properly show up. There is still a bug where the visuals do not line up in some
      circumstances with the target but it is a vast improvement over nothing.
  - bugfix: The Lightning wizard spell will now properly target bots and mechas.
  - bugfix: Wizards can no longer cast Lightning on themselves, which didn't do anything
      because they are immune to their own Lightning.
  - bugfix: Fixed an exploit where a gun could have unlimited damage by repeatedly
      attempting to perform point-blank shots with a ballistic weapon while not actually
      being able to fire the gun, such as through wearing boxing gloves, and then
      firing the weapon.
  - tweak: Hitting a missing limb with a projectile will no longer hit the target,
      but instead display a missing message and what limb is missing.
  - tweak: Improved the Stormtrooper Blaster Rifle's ability to miss its targets.
  - tweak: The EMP effect from the Lightning spell is now more severe.
  - tweak: The Lightning spell will no longer cause blurriness and stuttering.
  - tweak: The Lightning spell will no longer chain arc to other targets if it hits

      they should never miss.
  - bugfix: APCs with their covers knocked off will now properly unexpose the wires.
2024-07-16:

  mentgah:
  - tweak: You can now add whole eggs to pans on help intent without cracking them,

  - bugfix: Mindless cyborgs, AIs and MoMMIs can now be properly transformed.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where a piece of code responsible for generalized damaged
      dealing could, in some cases (mostly regarding species resistances and weaknesses
      to damage types) do far more damage than intended.
  - tweak: Internal wounds will no longer be considered sources of damage to determine
      limb damage.
  - experiment: Attempted a fix where humans transformed into other humans through
      means such as the Staff of Change will now properly transfer their damage over
      instead of being completely healed.
  - tweak: Grues will now strip the flesh off of the bones of humans they kill instead
      of gibbing them, unless they are races with no blood such as plasmamen. They
      can chomp them again to gib them.
  - tweak: Grues can no longer gain power from eating pure skeletons. Does not include
      plasmamen or liches.
  falcon2346:
  - imageadd: Added new sprites.
  jwhitak:
  - rscadd: Bug reports now show byond client version and build.
2024-07-19:
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where eating non-humanoid things such as monkeys or creatures
      as a grue would cause an error and completely prevent the grue from using most
      abilities.
2024-07-20:
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Removed a redundant line of code in item attacking code that did not do
      anything.

      temperatures at roundstart.

2024-07-23:
  Eneocho:
  - bugfix: Fixes PCP not being added to the HYPERZINES define, thus not behaving
      like hyperzine for any interaction.
  - rscadd: Regular antimatter tanks can now be refueled at a decent rate by exposing
      them to radiation.
  - tweak: Antimatter Decelerator tanks (the trader one) will refuel 25x faster than
      the regular tank and can hold 10x the fuel (10000).
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where reviving at least twice with the phylactery would completely
      wipe out the lich's list of spells.
  - bugfix: Fixed a runtime caused by an attempt to find a spell's button in the spell
      menu when it didn't have any (such as the No Gun Allowed spell)
  - bugfix: A soulstone that is used to fuel a phylactery will now properly change
      to its inert icon. It will also no longer allow the user for a brief period
      of time to summon the shade it just used on the phylactery, which did nothing.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where certain elements for the No Gun Allowed, Bind Object
      and Magical Wardrobe spells were not being properly transferred due to a missing
      "user" variable.
  - bugfix: No Gun Allowed will now properly allow someone to fire a weapon again
      when removed.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the wizard and wizard's apprentice scoreboards would
      show spells learned from spellbooks as being absorbed.
  - bugfix: Should fix an error with the wizard and wizard's apprentice scoreboard
      where spells would show up at least twice, and generally improved them a little.
  - tweak: Adjusted the phylactery set's spawns so that the phylactery itself is more
      likely to appear above the necromancer clothes instead of under them.
  - bugfix: Removed unused code regarding monkeys being attacked with items, and the
      monkeys already take damage through other systems.
  - bugfix: Fixed a 7-year-old bug where slimes wouldn't do roughly 4 of the emotes
      they were meant to do once in a while because the emote system was checking
      to see if they were a monkey. They can now bounce, jiggle, light up for a bit
      and vibrate.
  - rscdel: Creatures and silicons that are attacked by burn-causing melee weapons
      such as the scrying orb will no longer be spammed with "Aargh it burns!" in
      every attack.
  - bugfix: Cleaned a section of the game's code where item attacks against slimes
      were defined. It should now be easier for future coders to read the piece of
      code where it used to be.
  - bugfix: Surrendering via a character that wasn't male nor female should no longer
      say "they surrender%s!", and will now properly say "they surrender!".
  - rscadd: Robots now have an unique message when surrendering.
  - bugfix: Fixed a critical bug with slimes so that critical hits will now affect
      how likely they are to be pushed away when hit.
  - bugfix: Fixed a 4-months-old bug where cyber horrors couldn't inject medical nanobots.
  - bugfix: The "Set Holiday" admin command will now show up to admins in their command
      panel.
  - bugfix: Fixed a 7-year-old bug where peg limbs couldn't be properly removed by
      less damaging weapons.
  - bugfix: Fixed a 7-year-old bug where non-sharp items with enough force did not
      have any chance of ripping off a limb as opposed to turning it into gibs. The
      check has now been fixed and now strong blunt melee weapons have a chance to
      rip off a broken limb instead of gibbing a broken limb.
  - bugfix: Removed unused code which concerned attacking with slimes in order to
      cause brain damage, which was unused for a variety of reasons including; regular
      slimes cannot be picked up, the code only works with items, and it only worked
      against non-carbon mobs which, as far as I know, are not affected by brain damage.
  - bugfix: Emotes that change their wording based on the user's gender will now properly
      affect non-humans such as monkeys.
  - bugfix: Removed an unused proc that was getting called by the code regarding monkeys
      being attacked with items.
  jwhitak:
  - bugfix: Closed exploit where you could see what a traitor purchased as a non-admin
2024-07-25:
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Wizards can upgrade the Pitbull spell to summon Toadline Pitbulls for
      20 spell points. Toadline Pitbulls move slightly slower than a regular pitbull,
      but have the advantage of being able to pass through airlocks and other mobs
      unimpeded (the airlock pass is NOT instantaneous, it takes a bit). They also
      do 1 more Brute damage on average compared to a regular Pitbull.
  - rscadd: Restores the Tracking Bacon dish that was commented out 12 years ago.
      They behave like regular tracking beacons, but can be eaten and can be cooked
      with 10u corn oil, 5u salt and a slab of meat.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: The ninja's energy blade is now slightly sharper.

  - bugfix: Fixed an incorrect typepath in update_icons.dm
  - tweak: Tracking beacons are no longer flammable.
2024-07-31:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Hologram Projectors nullspacing items worn or held by holograms
      when they die.
  - bugfix: Fixed Hologram Projector player transitions between pAI and Hologram (quickly
      swapping from one to the other should no longer cause any issues)
  - bugfix: Fixed the Hologram Projector's ray not properly tracking the hologram
      or its projector in most cases.
  - rscadd: pAI slotted inside a Hologram Projector can now re-spawn their hologram
      if it disappeared without requiring outside help, using a new button under the
      pAI Commands tab.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - bugfix: Siberian chifir now shows up with its icon again.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - rscadd: Added a wider amount of content to the Trader's "Yamtar" crate, containing
      unique items that can greatly aid in medical endeavors.
  - tweak: The "Yamtar" crate is slightly less likely to have a suit sensing wand.
  - rscadd: DNA syringes that contain a single block will now have the block's number
      in their name.
  - tweak: The Genetics' DNA Scanner's "transfer" function will now only irradiate
      as much as a DNA injector would, which is far less.
2024-08-01:
  DeityLink:
  - imageadd: Painting over the new library carpets and wooden floors now looks as
      it should.
  - bugfix: Fixed soulblade that don't have a shade in them behaving weirdly when
      thrown at non-cultists.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Toggle Anonymity cult hood button failing to update your character's
      visible name when examined or hovered.
  - bugfix: Added keybinds for Soul Blade spells (courtesy of Yred). In regular mode,
      press Insert to Spin and End to Perforate. In Hotkey mode, press F to Spin and
      R to Perforate.
  - bugfix: Using click-drag to perform the Perforate spell as a Soul Blade no longer
      sends you always south if you click-drag from the Soul Blade's tile. (courtesy
      of Yred)
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Juicy fruit will splash its reagents in an area.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a year-old bug where the Staff of Swip-Swap couldn't be wielded.
      Now it can be wielded to empower the projectile, which allows it to go through
      windows.
  - bugfix: (Admins) Changing the "detachable_cell" variable for energy weapons will
      now also handle whether it will give the gun the respective "Detach Cell" verb
      or not.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where a person that has carp pheromones in their system would
      not stink up the place properly if someone nearby was dead, which would unpredictably
      cause the message to not reliably show up to other players in the area.
2024-08-07:
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Squash plants! Mutate a pumpkin to get your very own squash. They are
      not as efficient at making nutriment, but are filled with precious Squash (reagent).
  - rscadd: The Squash reagent/drug is a double edged performance enhancer that boosts
      your tackling abilities. If consumed by non dwarves, they'll suffer brute damage
      for 30s before turning into a dwarf (as long as Squash is still in their system).
      If they run out of squash, the recoil from growing back to normal size will
      break every bone in their body, unless their bones were reinforced with Degencalcium
      beforehand.
  - rscadd: The Squash drug can be manufactured by mixing equal parts Manly Dorf,
      Degenerate Calcium and Hyperzine.
  - tweak: The Caber can now self recharge once per minute and has the proper sharpness
      flags when on its detonated state.
  - rscadd: "Methamphetamine can be made stationside by enterprising chemists. Slower\
      \ and way more expensive to make but overall better than hyperzine, and performance\
      \ enhancing, too. It does make you tweak out at times, though. Made by mixing\
      \ 1 part Albuterol, 3 parts Hydrogen, 1 part Chlorine and 5u Carbon (catalyst),\
      \ then heating to 200\xB0C, which makes 2 parts meth."
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: A neo-ultra-capitalism mode Old Vendotron will no longer kill itself by
      summoning a lot of hostile creatures that it would proceed to go to combat with,
      and now the creatures it creates become part of the same faction as it.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Old Vendotron's plate attack so that it will no longer throw
      plates on its own tile. It will now properly throw them away.
  - tweak: Slimes will now become ravenous in the presence of monkeys, causing them
      to become hungry and thus try to eat anything they can reach (including the
      monkeys), which also allows the slimes to feed far sooner on the monkeys than
      they otherwise would.
  - tweak: Slimes can now store slightly more nutrition, meaning that they can develop
      into adult slimes and then split by eating two monkeys in a smaller form instead
      of having to eat a monkey in a smaller form and another monkey in a larger form.
  hacker-on-steroids:
  - rscadd: ripley killdozer kit - adds tons of armor and allows you to put guns onto
      the ripley
  - rscadd: add killdozer kit to uplink (10tc)

      them.
  - imageadd: Added new pulsing heart surgery box sprite.
  SonixApache:
  - rscadd: Detective scanners can now be alt-clicked to switch to scan-only mode,
      which prevents it from being put into boxes/coats/etc. Do note that this also
      prevents the scanner from taking fingerprint cards.
  - experiment: You can now use hand labelers on storage items like boxes and backpacks,
      among other things. If you notice something breaking with labelling, report
      it.
2024-08-10:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Airflow is now visible, as dust motes can be seen flying around between
      zones when the pressure differential is high enough for there to be wind.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Vomit can be electrolized into equal parts sacid and nutriment, or made
      with equal parts sacid and nutriment, plus 5u Enzyme.

      are faster (1 second).
  - rscadd: You can now wet hides in a sink/groundwater, and air dry them slowly.
      Hot rooms still dry them faster.
  - rscadd: Wet leather now tells you if it's drying, and how much it has left to
      dry.
  - bugfix: Fixed wet leather deleting itself in your hands.

      to access, swapping the places of the bin and a locker in the room.
2024-08-13:
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: 'Changes the sharp, brunt, and quality modifiers for a couple materials:'
  - tweak: Gold brunt modifier goes from 0.5x to 0.9x, and quality modifier from 1.7x
      to 1.8x
  - tweak: Silver brunt modifier goes from 0.7x to 0.2x, and sharpness modifier from
      0.7x to 1.8x
  - tweak: Mythril quality modifier goes from 1.5x to 3x, to account for it being
      so scarce and generally being outperformed by Phazon and Bananium.
2024-08-16:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Hydro Tray lights now update immediately after pouring a reagent into it
      (reagents still get processed by the tray over time, but the lights anticipate
      how much the reagents currently held will change the tray's variables)
  - tweak: Paint reagents are now slightly toxic to hydroponics plants, except flax
      oil which is slightly nutritious.
  - tweak: Water and Holy Water now hydrate trays just as much
  - tweak: Toxins in hydro tray and soil now become progressively more visible as
      it builds up, instead of suddenly becoming visible past a threshold.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: All botany mutagens now take the same average time to tick and to get consumed
      (as fast as the previous fast chems).
  - tweak: Phazon weapons and hammers (blacksmithing) will no longer delete themselves
      when used a bunch, and will instead teleport to a random tile within a radius
      around itself, scaling with quality, up to a radius of 13 tiles with legendary
      weapons.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - tweak: Lotto tickets with numbers from the random event are now more likely to
      be winners, as the highest ballcount is now 18 and not 32.

      of methylin.
  toomykins:

2024-08-18:
  DeityLink:
  - imageadd: The old vaguely dandelion-looking weeds have had an art pass and now
      look slightly more like dandelions.
  - rscadd: Added dandelion seeds to the MegaSeed Servitor's contraband products.
  - rscadd: Dandelions may be harvested as soon as their yellow flowers have bloomed,
      but waiting further will allow the flowers to turn into pappus, which can be
      harvested themselves.
  - rscadd: Dandelion flowers can be ground for their yellow dye, or turned into leafy
      incense by using it on an incense oil container.
  - rscadd: Dandelion pappus can be used 3 times to spread their seeds onto nearby
      empty trays or soil.
  - rscadd: Dandelions both in trays or harvested as pappus will spread their seeds
      when exposed to air currents.
  - imageadd: Added in-hand icons for Dandelions, Sunflowers, Harebells, Novaflowers
      and Moonflowers.
  - bugfix: Pre-mapped tower-cap logs can now be properly have their seeds extracted.
  - bugfix: Flavor texts when plants mutate and whatnot should now properly account
      for the plant's designation being singular or plural.
  - rscadd: Dandelions can be mutate into Dandelions(?) which re-use the old weeds
      sprites.
2024-08-19:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed gases leaving hydro trays despite their lid being closed.
  - bugfix: Fixed vines spawning outside hydro trays despite their lid being closed
      when they have just acquired the mutation.
  - bugfix: Dead plants can no longer mutate further.
  - bugfix: Fixed connected pipes not updating their atmosphere as they should when
      canisters and hydroponic trays connected to them change their content.
  - tweak: You can now pour water and nutriments inside hydroponic trays even with
      their lid closed. The flavor text is slightly different to reflect you using
      its injection port. Likewise using a hoe or clippers on a tray now has flavor
      text specify that you use its access port.
2024-08-20:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed seconds display when checking your wristwatch.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: Holomen no longer suffocate on low air conditions nor get intoxicated by
      atmospheric gases.
  - rscadd: You can now buy semi-randomized small town brewery beer kegs in cargo
      for 60 credits, these are safe.
  - rscadd: Hacking the cargo console lets you buy the off-brand beer kegs for 40
      credits, which can contain dangerous chemicals, but also extra special chems.
  - rscadd: These beer kegs will be VERY contaminated (at least 1 dangerous chemical
      on average) if the station is on the DOES NOT TIP backdoor.
  - bugfix: Adds Iced Beer to the COLDDRINKS define (i had forgotten iced beer was
      a thing).
  - tweak: The Does Not Tip backdoor uplink description also mentions it poisoning
      beers.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - spellcheck: The mounted sleepers and jail cells on mechs no longer print the object
      types to the occupant when they run out of power.

      cell.
2024-08-21:
  CrazyAmphibian:

      to re-open the menu to see them)
  Dacendeth:
  - tweak: Grues health regen has been lowered massively
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Hydroponic trays containing dead weeds may now be overtaken by fresh new
      weeds.
  - rscadd: Plants exposed to radiation now have a chance to mutate. Young plants
      planted in the past minute have a high chance of mutating, while older ones
      have a very small chance of a minor gene mutation (if all your trays in Hydroponics
      have plants and a radiation storm occurs, expect 3-5 of them to display a small
      mutation). Furthermore, closing the tray's lid completely removes any chance
      of radiation-induced mutations.
  - tweak: If a plant mutates to different species, it will no longer have an additional
      small mutation applied at the same time.
  Eneocho:
  - spellcheck: Typofix on the NO TIP beer keg description.

      second.
  - tweak: AI messages when they stop being able to follow a target are now more general,
      as cameras are not the only thing that stops tracking.
  west3436:
  - bugfix: Igniters will now start fires 100% of the time
2024-08-22:
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Expands the braindamage speech, adding a good amount of extra words and
      syllables that will be replaced with their dumb counterpart. Braindamaged players
      might also find themselves forgetting a word once in a while.
  - rscadd: Braindamaged players might find themselves gibbering incoherently if they
      try to speak too fast.
  - tweak: Reduces the forced screaming chance and forced stutter chance when talking
      while braindamaged by 15 and 5 percent respectively, since those values felt
      better with this change.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - tweak: Catbeasts defiling rooms for threat generation should now happen as soon
      as they enter the room.
2024-08-24:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added Moody Lights to Hydroponic trays. This concerns not only their warning
      lights, but also the tray's own light toggle which lights up the plant quite
      nicely in the dark, and the plant's own bioluminescence. Plant may have custom
      moody light overlays, but ones that don't just glow all over if the bioluminescent
      gene is spliced into them.
  - rscadd: Alt-Click on Hydroponic trays now brings up a radial menu to quickly toggle
      its light, its lid, or set its label.
  - rscadd: Ctrl-Click (while anchored) lets you quickly toggle the lid, which was
      what Alt-Click previously did.
  - rscadd: Hydroponic trays now react to EMPs, having a chance to turn off their
      light and toggle their lid.
  - imageadd: Re-sprited the hydroponic tray lids. Added animations and sounds when
      you toggle them.
  - imageadd: Hydroponic tray sprites have been tweaked to display whether their internal
      light is on or off.
  - imageadd: The water level in hydroponic trays now visibly goes down.
  - imageadd: Some large plants now have an alternative appearance when constrained
      by a closed lid.
  - imageadd: If a plant exudes plasma or sleeping gas and its lid is closed, you
      can now see the gas through the lid.
  - imageadd: Improved the way plants grow visually so that more of their sprited
      stages may appear over the course of their growth.
  - imageadd: Hydroponic Trays now have a different sprite when they are un-anchored.
  - imageadd: Hydroponic Trays now have a visible vent when wrenched on top of a connector.
  - bugfix: Fixed some more the way Hydroponic Trays transfer gas when connected to
      a pipenet, or when their lid is open in general. You may now even use them as
      slow, one-way, passive vents.
  - tweak: Newly built hydroponic trays now require you to fill them with water.
  - rscadd: You can now build plastic hydroponic trays! Easy to build, but just like
      with soil it won't provide you with any of the sensor data.
  - tweak: Hydroponic Trays now consume a bit of power.  Just a bit though.
2024-08-25:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: The following changes have been done to the Rampant Brand Intelligence
      event. The original infected vending machine is now guaranteed to emit one of
      its custom slogans when it infects another vending machine, making players more
      likely to find it (and to hear those slogans at all like jesus christ the odds
      were ridiculously low). When the event ends, ALL infected machines stop throwing
      items instead of only 90 percent, and their speakers now return to their previous
      value instead of always being deactivated.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Lucky coins on a string have a second chance to be pulled out successfully,
      scaling with coin luck (not yours).
  - rscadd: Metastable Mutagen, a chem that selectively mutates the chemicals on plants,
      letting you semi-reliably remove (and add) chems via mutations. Made with equal
      parts Unstable Mutagen and Charcoal, with 5u Enzyme as a catalyst.
  - rscadd: Metatable Mutagen, a sibling to Metastable Mutagen that does the same,
      but it will also randomly transform into any of the other tables in the game
      if sprayed onto them. Made with equal parts Untable Mutagen (the botany version)
      and Charcoal, with 5u Enzyme as a catalyst.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - tweak: Lighting and object subsystems are now notably faster, with about 2.2 seconds
      shaved off server initialization overall on boxstation as an example
2024-08-26:
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - bugfix: The chameleon DNA gene now properly sets mob alpha back to normal when
      deactivated.
  - bugfix: Ghosts can now properly admin possess objects.
  - bugfix: Deleting an item now properly releases possession, if any.
  - tweak: Posessing and releasing is now handled in one verb.

2024-08-27:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Apiaries no longer require you to build them into an hydroponics tray!
      Just click an adjacent floor while holding the kit.
  - imageadd: Apiaries have new sprites to commemorate their graduation from being
      tray-bound.
  - imageadd: Apiary kits now have in-hand icons.
  - tweak: You no longer need a hatchet to harvest an apiary and can now do so bare-handed.
      Doing it this way no longer deconstructs the apiary so you can just calm the
      bees and let them return to it on their own. Hatchets (or alternatively crowbars)
      are still required to deconstruct them, which still also harvests them at the
      same time if they contain honey.
  - soundadd: Added sounds for building/deconstructing apiaries, and for pouring BeezEz
      in them.
  - rscadd: Apiaries and hives can burn down at long last.
  jwhitak:
  - rscadd: Blacksmiths can now estimate the quality of their result before quenching
      their work by examining it.
  - rscadd: Smithing now has several new visual effects, including lighting, hot sparks,
      and visibly different unforged items.
  - bugfix: Fixed several blacksmithing bugs, including lighting cold forges that
      can't heat anything.

  - tweak: Changed the RPD menu so that the options are always visible
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Moody Lights have been added to all airlocks, firelocks, and blast doors.
  - bugfix: Fixed christmas lights now actually emitting any light. Their lit up sprite
      also now appears over darkness.
  - bugfix: Fixed snow tiles not regenerating snow like they should sometimes.
  - bugfix: Fixed each snow tile and christmas light having a duplicate on top of
      them.
  - tweak: Reworked the way snow tiles hold snow so instead of losing snow from the
      duplicate tile you get even more! Each tile now has 10 snow which it regenerates
      by one every 30 seconds. You can grab 1 snow by hand, or 3 at a time by shovel.
      If the tile reaches 0 snow it disappears.
  - imageadd: Re-added the grabbed and digged snow tile sprites so you can easily
      see whether a tile is full of snow, or whether it's one shovel hit away from
      disappearing.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Cows will mutate their milk type when exposed to Phazon, unless they themselves
      can make Phazon, in which case they will not mutate their milk further.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - bugfix: Coinboxes can now come out of vending machines again.
  - tweak: Coinboxes and vendpacks now eject from crowbar destroying vending machines.
      Vendpacks still require inserted cardboard for this.
  - tweak: Coinboxes can now be recycled for metal, under the electronics category.
  - tweak: To compensate coinboxes being recyclable, and as to not be an infinite
      metal source, they are now required in their frame build step. A no access requirement
      version of them can be built as a metal stack recipe to aid this.
  - bugfix: Mech syringe guns now actually fire their syringes properly, making them
      finally useful for something other than getting fast research done.
2024-08-30:
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - tweak: Placing stacks into storage items now automatically adds it to stacks of
      the same type, if possible.
  - tweak: Ore satchels and derivatives now show the number of ores in all stacks
      per type.
  - bugfix: Sheet snatchers no longer cause bad screen issues.
  west3436:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where players would appear to be on fire without actually
      burning.
  - tweak: Mobs will now catch on fire as soon as they step into a fire.
2024-08-31:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: The Floral Somatoray has been refactored and should now behave more as
      you might expect. You can use it on trays both at range and adjacently, although
      if someone is standing in-between they might get hit instead.
  - rscadd: You can once again change the brute damage of bees by using the Floral
      Somatoray on apiaries while it's set to Morphology, while Development controls
      the yield. There are plans to allow further genetic alterations of bees in the
      future.
  - rscadd: You can now use a solder to "un-emag" a floral somatoray.
  - imageadd: The Floral Somatoray has had a sprite pass with its appearance depending
      on its currently selected mode. The rays it fire also change color based on
      the selected mode.
  - soundadd: The Floral Somatoray makes a new sound when charging and firing at stuff.

      bag of holding really fast with hotkeys.

      to regenerate with their special ability

2024-09-02:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Chaplains who adhere to the Belmont religion now spawn with a box containing
      clothing reminiscent of Richter Belmont, and a flask of Sacred Water in their
      pocket. They can also throw their bible to hit people around them with it.
  - rscadd: Sacred Water is a new reagent that turns Holy Water into more of itself
      when in contact with it. When splashed on a floor, it creates sacred flames
      that only burn the unholy (that is, vampires, cultists, and any other supernatural
      creature)
  - rscadd: Players may now forge a Battle Cross out of silver at an anvil. Battle
      Crosses are basically boomerangs that deal bonus damage to supernatural creatures,
      but they only return to the hands of those of the Belmont religion.
  - experiment: Boomerangs have been rewritten from scratch and now behave more like
      you would expect from a boomerang in a video game. They are now a lot more reliable
      so their damage has been lowered from 16 to 10, but they still feel really strong
      so I'm looking forward to feedback by players who have been on both ends of
      a boomerang throw.
  - imageadd: Boomerangs have also gotten a re-sprite.
  - imageadd: Attacking supernatural creatures with holy weapons now displays a visual
      effect.
  - imageadd: Kamina and Simon's glasses have gotten some visual adjustments on top
      of proper object icons. Furthermore, you can now unleash their power by using
      them in your hand and throwing them.
  - bugfix: Fixed the wrong icon appearing for some bibles in the religion picker
      interface.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - bugfix: The mode change buttons on assemblies now properly refresh them.
  - tweak: Assembly windows now refresh as the timers tick down, instead of manually
      with the refresh button.
  - tweak: Unnecessary close and refresh buttons have now been removed from the UIs
      of timers, proximity sensors, infrared sensors and light tile remotes as these
      functions happen normally now.

      better grammar, and no extra full stop.

      described, this will not count for turf or HUD clicks.

  - tweak: The message the player receives on being targeted now more helpfully tells
      them which restrictions are or are not in place.

2024-09-06:
  west3436:
  - bugfix: MoMMIs, Engineering cyborgs, and any cyborgs which have a fire shield
      installed will no longer catch on fire or take damage from fire.
  - bugfix: Objects will properly stop smoking once they are removed from a hot room.
2024-09-07:
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Clowns can buy Insulted gloves from the autodrobe, these may also be found

      while wearing them, or you will get insulted when you get shocked.
2024-09-08:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: You can now paint clay pots using a painting brush or paint roller. Nano
      paint glows in the dark on them.

      some of the tedium of producing those, and also raising awareness of their existence.
  - rscadd: You can now empty an ashtray's contents in a disposal unit by simply clicking
      on the bin with the ashtray. If the ashtray is empty it will be thrown in it

      in them.
  - soundadd: Ashtrays now make sound when hit and thrown.
  - rscadd: Broken ashtrays are now properly considered trash items (and thus may
      persist through rounds)
  - tweak: The area lights that appear during alerts are now additive, meaning that
      they don't make your eyes hurt as much, and improve visibility and mood overall.
  - bugfix: Fixed airlocks appearing black for an instant when they flicker their
      lights in an area that doesn't have dynamic lighting.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - rscadd: Hostile mobs spawned in mob cubes are now logged to admins, telling them
      who opened it and where.
  - tweak: Extra erroneous window panels on packed bridge wing have been removed.
  - tweak: The misaligned shuttle diagonal wall on the medical escape pod has been
      fixed.
  - bugfix: Mobs that end up inside large wooden crates now show up when they get
      dismantled.
  - tweak: Self heating cup ramen now only requires the container for the reaction,
      and does not use calcium oxide within, now only requiring 10u of water to heat
      and not 12.
  - spellcheck: The millilitres on cup ramen's description have been changed to reference
      units, for consistency.
  - tweak: Extra panes on synergy permabrig glass have been removed.
  - tweak: Extra air alarms in synergy secure armory and HoS office have been removed.
  - tweak: Disposals machinery on synergy is now accessible without breaking glass.

  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - bugfix: Timer and proximity sensor assemblies now accurately tick their timers
      down to the second instead of every two seconds, and timed from the moment they
      were activated. For consistency, all pre-spawned chem grenades now have their
      arm time doubled as to make them activate in the same amount of time as before
      this change.
  - bugfix: Proximity sensors now count down to zero in the same manner as timers.
  - tweak: Map checking verbs now all output to a browser window instead of the chat
  - tweak: Map rendering no longer lags the server while a round is active, unless
      set to in server config
  - tweak: The camera and intercom range view debug verbs now only show the images
      to the client that pressed them, instead of the whole server
  - tweak: The camera range view debug verb now takes the actual view range of a camera
      into account
  - bugfix: Thermometers and stethoscopes can now fit in medical belts
