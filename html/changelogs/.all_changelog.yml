2015-08-06:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: Cult Hoods now also protect from bible deconvertion
  - rscdel: Null Rods no longer deconvert. I mean seriously what the fuck? 25% chance
      per hit to deconvert that bypasses all protections? Who thought that was a good
      idea? The Null Rod has already way enough uses against cult (fighting constructs,
      removing runes, protecting from runes and talismans,...)
  Dylanstrategie:
  - experiment: Many score items have been refurbished, values have been tweaked and
      a few items were even added
  - rscdel: Gamemode-specific score items have been removed due to being extremely
      problematic

      it may only be accessed by a centcomm ID.
  - rscdel: Areas of the shuttles using the new system no longer clutter the map,
      and are replaced by invisible docking ports which do not affect gameplay in
      any way (although they are visible to ghosts)

  - tweak: Artificers cannot destroy regular walls anymore, however they can still
      destroy cult walls.
  - rscadd: Destroyed/Thermited cult walls leave a cult floor behind (reminder that
      those are basically reinforced floors, you remove them with a wrench, not with
      a crowbar).

      the flying fairy wings in their hands and let them wear another exosuit, such
      as an armor or spacesuit. Now players stop flying as soon as they remove the
      wings from their suit slot.
  - bugfix: The *flap and *aflap emotes are now gender-sensitive (X flaps his/her
      wings).

2015-08-16:
  N3X15:
  - experiment: Caps added to number of light sources and lighting overlays processed

  Pomf123:
  - rscadd: Pomf added another shitty spell, this one is offensive.
2015-08-17:
  Comic:

      as they are on different layers.

      and wrenched pipe, changing the pipe dispenser's layer, or using a pipe planner.

  - rscadd: Added a new pipe, the layer manifold, that connects to pipes on any other
      layer.

  - rscadd: Ventcrawling mobs can change which layer they crawl through while in a
      layer manifold.
  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Fixed players being sent into nullspace (black screen) when inside a decapitated
      head that gets deleted. Often happens to people falling into singularities.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - experiment: All Syndicate roles (Traitor, Autotraitor, Double Agents, Nuclear
      Operatives) now get a standardized greeting, both for immersion and warning
      people they actually ARE the antagonists of the round
  - tweak: Fabricated Welding Tools (Autolathe) now start empty
  N3X15:
  - bugfix: HTML assets are sent before minimap generation, probably making character
      setup load times more tolerable.
  - experiment: Added additional profiling data to server startup messages, and improved
      logging of these messages.
  - tweak: Minimap generation no longer done as a background thread.
  - tweak: Removed some blood spatter caching messages, making logs more readable.

      way as posibrains. There is a 1 minute window (just like posibrains), and after
      said window the diona dies if no candidate has been found.
  Unid:
  - tweak: When examining a mob, it's possible to see its size and whether it has

      inside.
  - tweak: Reworked the procedure to harvest Honeycombs.
  - rscdel: You cannot obtain honey by merely using a beaker on an apiary anymore.
  - imageadd: Added a custom sprite for honey-storing condiment bottles.
  - rscadd: Hitting a bee or firing at it will now cause it and its neighbors to charge
      at the attacker.
  - bugfix: Bees can finally be calmed by spraying them with water. They also have
      a slightly different sprite when they are feral.
  - rscadd: You can now use bee nets by clicking on tiles instead of clicking on the
      item in your hand.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that cause apiaries to feed WAY too much nutrients to the
      hydro trays near it.
  - tweak: Apiaries still distribute and gather nutrients automatically, however,
      the "benefits" they give to nearby plants are now granted by the bees themselves.
      If a bee is above a plant ready for harvest, it'll halve its aging process so
      it remains alive longer, else it'll accelerate it so it becomes ready for harvest
      more quickly. It'll also halve the plant's weed and pest spread, and collect
      some of the plant's toxins for the apiary. (Toxins collected this way will find
      their way into the honeycombs, and will also drastically increase the sting
      power of bees).
  - rscadd: Added chapters to "The Ins and Outs of Apiculture - A Precise Art" manual
      that explains how to capture feral bees and how to harvest honeycombs.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that allowed players to use modification kits at any range.
  - rscadd: Added a beekeeping bio suit and hood to the Beekeeping Crates, as well

      a tile away.

  Kurfurst:

  - rscadd: The SPS properly reports while inside containers.
  - rscadd: New proc stripped(mob,mob)

  - tweak: Rehauled the admin menu for shuttle manipulation
  - tweak: Docking port placement is now better
2015-08-21:
  Pomf123:
  - experiment: Diona now properly take extra damage from fire based attacks. Skeletons
      now take 2x damage from physical attacks. Plasmamen take half as much damage
      from fire as the-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
  - tweak: Reduce damage from hitting something while being thrown by half.
2015-08-22:
  Pomf123:

2015-08-25:
  Deity Link:
  - experiment: THE EXPERIMENTAL GUNS UPDATE IS LIVE!!
  - experiment: 10 NEW ORIGINAL WEAPONS ADDED. Half of them can be obtained during
      any round, the other half have certain requirements. I won't go into details
      here. Have fun trying to get them all!
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused the Power Gloves's electrical arc to be invisible,
      and refined its code so the arc looks much nicer.
  - rscadd: Reworked projectile pathing and appearance. Projectiles now follow a proper
      Bresenham path, which means you're less likely to hit something that you didn't
      intend to hit.
  - rscadd: Projectiles appear to follow a linear path, coders can force specific
      projectiles to not appear linear. The Captain's laser gun and the Retro laser
      gun's projectiles don't appear linear. (but still follow a Bresenham path)
  - rscadd: Turrets, Mechas, and ED209 projectiles follow the new pathing as well.
  - rscadd: Turrets now make noises when they fire.
  - imageadd: Replaced recharger sprites. Players can see which gun is currently being
      recharged. They know also have a visibly different sprite when they are unanchored.
      You can longer place a gun in an unanchored recharger.
  - tweak: The Syndicate RPG now uses an actual rocket launcher fire sound, instead
      of a shotgun sound. Fired RPG projectiles now pick up speed gradually over half
      a second instead of being at bullet speed from the get go.
  - rscadd: Destroying projectiles such as pulse rifle beams can now also destroy
      tables.
  - rscadd: All projectiles now have a penetration variable, and all objects/mobs
      have a penetration_dampening variable. What this means for example is that bullets
      will now keep going after hitting a window. Projectiles can be made to only
      penetrate certain types of atoms. When a projectile goes through a wall, it
      loses a bit of damage and leaves markings on it, those can be removed with a
      soldering tool.
  - rscadd: All projectiles can now bounce off atoms. Beams now properly bounce off
      a player wearing an ablative armor. Ablative armor chance of deflection slightly
      increased. Energy based projectiles (such as ion bolts or electrodes), or staff
      of change/focus projectiles can be deflected as well.
  - bugfix: Fixed reinforced walls/girder being indestructible by destroying projectiles.
  - tweak: Slightly increased the size at which items placed in display cases appear.

      blocking them off.
  - bugfix: Modification Kits (such as the one that turn atmos hardsuits into their
      gold versions) can no longer be used at infinite range. Coders can now easily
      add new modification kits that can turn any item into any other item, not just
      hardsuits.
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: Fixed jaunters. They now delete when you spawn the portal, and the portal
      actually works.
  PJB3005:
  - rscadd: The power monitor now has a fancy chart.
  - tweak: The power monitor now has colour coding.
  Pomf123:
  - experiment: Useless
2015-08-26:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: Added "Beekeeper" to botanist alt job titles.
  - imageadd: Added a beekeeper jumpsuit.
  - bugfix: Gravity Wells no longer try to move atoms that are already on top of them.
  - bugfix: Gravity Well Gun projectiles aren't affected by singularities or narsie
      anymore, and thus can reliably keep them stuck in a place for the duration of
      the Gravity Well (Note that the Gravity Well can only pull singularities to
      its center once it has reached a certain size, which it takes about 12 seconds
      to reach).
  - bugfix: Singularities cannot be eaten by smaller singularities anymore.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Hookshot being able to pull you through grilles and closing
      doors and stuff.
  - bugfix: You can no longer holster the PGM Hecate II, the Stickybomb launcher,
      or the Gatling gun.
  - rscadd: Using the hookshot on a mob now creates attack logs.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that would make hookshots unable to fire, and their projectile
      chain to remain on the ground.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that would allow hookshots to let players clip through walls.
  - bugfix: Enthralling used to take 10 times less time than it was meant to (5 seconds,
      2.5 with charisma. instead of 50 seconds, 25 with charisma). It's been balanced
      to 30 seconds, 15 with charisma. At the very least you cannot be enthralled
      just by being slipped on a banana anymore. That should solve part of the enthralling
      problem.
  - imageadd: Shadowstep now leaves a brief animation behind.
  - tweak: Mist Form replaced with Bat Form. Doesn't extinguish you anymore, but leaves
      a scary bat behind. Also new animations.
  - tweak: Summon Bats now summons 3 bats instead of 2.
  Pomf123:
  - bugfix: Don't get hit by shit you throw while in a time bubble
  - tweak: beams don't act stupid when fired in time bubbles or when entering them.
  - tweak: humans are no longer stunned by lightning
  - tweak: silicons take 33% less damage from lightning since they take 10 brute damage
      from an EMP.

  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added carp pheromones, created by mixing carpotoxin, leporazine and carbon.

      them instead (without attacking).

  Deity Link:
  - tweak: Fixed a few helmets/hoods that were hiding your glasses/beard when they
      shouldn't.
  - bugfix: Hopefully fixed Bomberman Arenas not properly putting players inside the
      spawned Bombermen
  - rscadd: Bomberman Arenas with more than 2 players now starts a 60 seconds countdown
      as soon as 2 players have registered, Which for example allows 2-9 players to
      fight on the 10-players map without requiring an admin to force-start the round.
  - rscadd: Thunderdome/Arena cameras are now fucking indestructible.
  - rscadd: You can now add voice analyzers to cameras, which will allow people near
      security camera computers connected to them to hear what people in view of those
      cameras are saying. Entertainment monitors broadcast to everyone that can see
      them.
  - tweak: Hookshots no longer knock you down when they reel you in, no matter which
      intent you're on.
  N3X15:
  - rscadd: Bees try to stay within 10m (5 tiles) of their nest, except when pissed.
2015-08-28:
  PJB3005:

      to occur
  - rscadd: You can now paint pipes any colour you want using the RPD.
  - bugfix: vents, connectors and scrubbers now visibily look as if they connect to

  - tweak: Traitors should now fail the Escape objective if they are restrained by
      a straight jacket in the shuttle's brig.
  PJB3005:
  - rscadd: Multitool device cloning, add a device to a multitool's linking buffer,
      click the multitool in-hand, then click other devices of the same kind to clone
      the ID and frequency! Currently unary / DP vents, scrubbers, air injectors and
      emitters supported.
2015-09-01:
  N3X15:
  - rscadd: 'Layer Adapter Pipe: Allows you to link a single layered pipe with a non-layered
      pipe.  Doesn''t look as ugly as a manifold, but is not as flexible.'
  - bugfix: Defficiency's Supermatter Engine has been overhauled. Gasses have been
      added, piping re-routed, and the control room actually works, among other fixes.  Still
      requires work to get running, but not as much as before.
  - bugfix: Defficiency's Atmospherics has been reworked a bit to use layered piping
      in some rather crowded areas.  A broken three-way valve has also been fixed.
  Pomf123:

  Unid:
  - rscadd: Teeth of aliens and some other animals may be harvested now

      vessel related steps in surgery for them
  - experiment: Changed movespeed modifiers, hyperzine and other magic sanic sources

      you have so that means if you're fucked enough by cold pain or whatever you
      can still possibly move slower than you'd like while hopped up on stims. Diona's
      base speed is unchanged, skellingtons have a +3 modifier which makes them a
      bit less than half as slow as diona, muton have a +1 modifier.
2015-09-06:

      count toward the 100-items-pull-per-tick cap. AKA Fixed the "large singularities
      don't pull anything" bug.
  - tweak: Sending bags of holding into singularities now creates EMPs instead of
      explosions. On top of that, it removes two thirds of the singularity's energy.
      If the Singularity is stage two or less (under 500 energy left) it will delete
      the singularity instead. In other words, Bags of Holding can now reliably destroy
      singularities, without blowing yourself up at the same time.
  - tweak: Explosions themselves still affect singularities like they used to (increase
      their energy, with a small chance of deleting them instead)
  - tweak: Hookshots no longer cause Beepsky or ED-209 bots to chase their users.

  - tweak: Added ion rifles and shotguns along with some ammo to the armory.

      The door will also open to those with upload access and allows access to the
      AI upload. The core itself is still accessible only through robotics (or an
      additional door hack).
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Firing small items out of a fire extinguisher now takes the object's speed

      someone with a bike horn will make it honk. That also means that admins can
      replace that sound with anything.

      Game. They can also be pressed twice as fast as regular bike horns since their
      sound is shorter.

      Still allows for the same functionality as the table too.
  - tweak: Heavily modified the list of weapons available at round end.
  - tweak: Nerfed the entrance of the gooncode facility. Buffed the second room (more

      for now.

      the server.
  - rscadd: Supermatter Shard delaminations now cause a station-wide EMP. The EMP
