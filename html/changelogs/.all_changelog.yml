  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Masks that can't be flipped now simply won't have a 'Flip Mask' button,
      as opposed to having a 'Flip Mask' button that does nothing but takes up space
      anyways.
2016-04-29:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: Blobs now emit a cloud of purple smoke over whatever they are affecting.
      So now you get a clear visual feedback when someone gets attacked by them, or
      they destroy something (wall or item).
  - rscadd: Huge revamp of the blob's visuals. Blobs now support two kind of looks.
      classic ones (made from 32x32 dmi) and new ones (made from 64x64 dmi)
  - rscadd: The new looks feature added overlays, animations, such as connections
      between the blobs, or various feedback animations (normal blob transmitting
      a pulse, factory producing a mob, resource producing a point, etc)
  - rscadd: The new looks also features a damage overlay, letting you know approximately
      how much health the blob part has. In the classic look, only the normal blobs
      have a damaged sprite.
  - rscadd: When a new blob gets created (through game mode, random event, or admin
      spawning), the overmind player gets to choose the blob's looks.
  - rscadd: Admins can set the looks of every blobs in the world by the push of a
      new button under the Fun tab.
  - rscadd: Resource blobs now look darker if the overmind they were connected to
      has died. Other overminds can hover near it to take ownership of them and re-activate
      them.
  - tweak: Overminds are now immune to singularities, their pull, and Nar-Sie.
  - rscadd: When a blob gets pulsed, it will now hurt any mob standing on their tile.
      Telescience teleporting you right next to the core so you can destroy it without
      any danger is no longer a viable strategy, unless you have a really good armor,
      a really powerful gun, and even then it will require some testing.
  - bugfix: Blobs cannot destroy docking ports anymore.
  - bugfix: The Blob Overmind's HUD now properly indicates how much health his core
      has.
  - rscadd: Added a lot of messages to Blob Overminds that trigger under a variety
      of conditions. Such as blobs near their core dying, a special blob that they've
      placed having been destroyed, or their core getting damaged.
  - rscadd: If there are multiple Blob Overminds in the world, they get instantly
      notified by the death of one of them. They also get notified by the death of
      any blob core, whether it had an overmind or not.
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Adds the mahoguny and the siren as admin-spawnable guns.
  - rscadd: Adds buckshot shells, orderable from Cargo in the shotgun shells crate.
  - tweak: The shotgun shells crate now contains a box of each kind of shell instead
      of ten loose lethal shells.
  - tweak: The railgun and blunderbuss can now be worn in the belt slot.
  - tweak: Diona now properly take increased burn damage from electrical shocks, and
      golems now properly take decreased burn damage from electrical shocks.
  - rscadd: All metal foam reactions will now create metal foam floors if they are
      on a space tile. Metal foam floors are airtight, but flimsy.
  - tweak: Metal foam reactions made with aluminum will no longer create metal foam
      walls.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Surgically attached limbs no longer magically transform when you attach
      them to another species' body (this means you can create a human with vox head,
      tajaran arms and muton legs).
  - tweak: Slightly changed how species restricted clothing works in respect to the
      above change. Now it's possible to, for example, wear vox magboots as a human
      - but only if both of the human's feet are vox talons.
2016-04-30:
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: EMP grenades now properly delete themselves after they trigger.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Vox traders now spawn with some money and coins.
  - rscadd: When vox traders spawn, they have an option to start with a traveler's
      ID. The ID has no access, and is only used for identification. Lore-wise, a
      traveler's ID is required to legally travel in human-controlled territories.
2016-05-01:
  Cloroxygen:
  - rscadd: Added Stationary Assembler MMIs - SAMMIs
2016-05-02:
  Zth:

  - bugfix: Portable and wall-mounted flashers no longer flash through sunglasses.
2016-05-06:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: The color of cult runes now matches the species blood color of whoever
      wrote it.
  - tweak: Tweaked the way cult runes look and pulsate a bit.
  - tweak: NPC hostile mobs with ranged weapons will no longer fire if there's a friendly
      unity between them and their target. Hivebots, aliens, syndicate agents, russians,
      etc, should stop killing each others now.
  - tweak: Ghosts now appear above the blob layer.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds now get notified when a new overmind appears in a blob
      core.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds now have a "damage overlay" that updates as their core
      takes damage. Similar to the one humans have when they take damage (screen borders
      become dark/reddish).
  - rscadd: Most of the Blob Overmind notifications added in the last update now have
      a (JUMP) button, so for example you can immediately find which of your blob
      nodes just got destroyed.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds have a new verb called "Call Overminds", which sends a
      notification to all the other overminds, along with a button allowing them to
      jump to you.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds that spawn in a blob core created by an Overmind are now
      called Blob Cerebrate. So they can easily tell which one of them was the original
      one (and the only one who can place new cores)
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Flesh to stone now lasts for 2.5 minutes rather than 8.5 minutes.
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: Adds back-from-the-dead regeneration for simple mobs, and adds it to certain
      mobs. Said mobs will need to have their bodies destroyed in some way to keep
      them down.
2016-05-07:
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: You may now only turn gas masks into ghetto space helmets, not every kind
      of mask that covers your face.
  - bugfix: Flipping a gas mask that's in the process of being turned into a ghetto
      space helmet no longer changes the icon incorrectly.
  cumoverme:
  - tweak: Fixed Ministation giving you stealing objectives for items which weren't
      in the station.
2016-05-08:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: (BLOB HUD) Blob Overminds now have their own amazing custom HUD. Points
      gauge on the left, Health gauge on the right. The health gauge start flashing
      when it gets low.
  - rscadd: (BLOB HUD) Buttons that require more points than you currently have appear
      grayscale.
  - rscadd: (BLOB HUD) You can always jump back to your core using the small button
      to the top left. The first 24 special blobs that you've created (not counting
      the ones that got destroyed) also appear at the top, and you can quickly teleport
      from one to another by clicking them.
  - rscdel: Removed the obsolete and broken Blob random event.
  - rscadd: Added two new random events, Blob Cluster and Blob Conglomerate. The former
      is like a medium intensity meteor shower, sending a handful of blobs and node
      blobs at the station (about as rare as Communications Blackout). The later is
      a high intensity meteor storm, sending blobs, node blobs, and a few blob cores
      (I had 2-3 cores per showers during testing. This one is much rarer, one of
      the rarest events in fact, along with alien infestation and electrical storm).
      Both events can only trigger after 30 minutes have elapsed.
  - soundadd: Blobs now make sounds when they attack mobs.
  - experiment: Added a new meteor gun intended for testing and debugging that lets
      its user choose which type of meteor to fire.
  - bugfix: As confirmed by dylan, meteors aren't supposed to move from a Z Level
      to the next. So it's getting fixed at last.
  - soundadd: Added a few new server restart sound files.
  Unid:
  - tweak: Vomiting now removes some chemicals from your body.
  - rscadd: You can now vomit into a toilet by standing over it. It's also possible
      to vomit into a reagent container (like a bucket or a beaker) by either standing
      over it, or holding it while vomiting. Vomiting into a container partially fills
      it.
  - rscadd: Pools of vomit now dry over time. You can use a dropper or a syringe on
      a fresh pool of vomit to extract some of the substance.
2016-05-09:
  Intigracy:
  - rscadd: Adds miniature black holes. They function exactly like bags of holding
      except they fit in pockets. Currently admin spawn only for obvious balance reasons.
2016-05-14:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: 'Made conveyor construction even simpler: Upon being built, conveyor belts
      will now try to copy configuration from adjacent conveyor switches, as well
      as other belts. Conveyor switches now also start with a random ID tag, rather
      than null.'
  Deity Link:
  - tweak: Blob Conglomerates can now only happen if there are 25 or more living players
      on the station. Including at least a sec officer and an engineer.
  - rscadd: Bomberman Bombs now affect blobs.
  Probe1:
  - rscadd: New Tradeship for Vox Traders on Box.  Requires a Vox Trader ID to access
      and use.  Make sure you accept that ID at round start if you want an easy way
      to trade.  Arrivals and Vox Outpost have been slightly modified to accomodate
      it, as well as a few minor bug fixes along the way to the general areas.
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Added more clown names.
  Sood:
  - rscadd: Admins may now toggle wages for all personal and departmental accounts
      in the game panel. This starts off disabled and must be added to config.txt
      to be auto-enabled.
  - rscadd: Admins can now modify the balance and wage payout of individual accounts,
      also via game panel.
  - tweak: Accounts database machine can now see what an account would earn per paycheck.
  - tweak: Power cables will no longer shock you unless you click on a cable end or
      are using tools on them.
  - tweak: This means that wirecutters on cables still might shock you but bruise
      packs will not.
  - tweak: UNLESS IT IS A CABLE END.
  Unid:
  - tweak: Refactored away missions.
  - rscadd: Admins can now spawn away missions during the round using a new button
      in the Admin tab.

      time to players with no ear protection.

      See the poll here: ss13.moe/index.php/poll/38'

  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Escape attempts from alien nests no longer carry over when you get trapped
      again on that same nest.
  - tweak: Aliens can no longer trap human players on nests if they are standing up.
      They need to at least tackle them first, or make them fall one way or another.
      Doesn't apply to braindeads.

  9600bauds:

      '?' or '!'.
  Kurfurst:

      on baby and adult domesticated slimes. This makes them able to be picked up
      for easy transport.
  Probe1:
  - tweak: PTech vends (HoP vending machines found on Metaclub and Mini) now stock
      all PDA cartridges and require HoP access to use.  Plus some minor formatting

      with the power/disability they have.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: 'Added a ''Load Map Element'' admin command that allows admins to spawn
      any vault, away mission or external map file into the game. Warning: loading
      large external map files may result in extreme lag.'

      stations etc.
  - bugfix: Also fixed Cyborgs and MoMMIs being able to weld/unweld a locker from

      thrown at a floor, and will gib dead bodies. It deals about 100 damage when
      thrown at mobs.

      immovable, explosion-proof, EMP-proof, and have 100 times the health of a standard

      them, like you would click to shoot a gun or throw an item. Directly hailing
      at someone will give them a big red bold message telling them to halt, and will
      specifically call them out by name in chat with the line ''(You) hails for X
      to halt!''. This also has aim assist in the form of working in a 3x3 square
      around where you clicked, to make it easier to hail moving targets.'
  - imageadd: New Hailer warning sprites courtesy of Blithering.
  - rscadd: MoMMI material synthetizers can now scan wooden planks, plastic sheets,
      and carpet tiles. They still cannot scan anything else. Likewise, borg/human

  DrCelt:
  - tweak: changes the effect of high pressure on heat loss.
  - tweak: disables high pressure heat loss multiplier effect on ventcrawling mobs.
  Exxion:
  - tweak: Bandoliers are now accessories rather than exosuits. This means they attach
      directly to your jumpsuit rather than taking up your exosuit slot. They can
      be removed with the Remove Accessory verb. You should be able to figure out
      how to use them. Note that, like other storage accessories, they must be removed
      in order to take the jumpsuit off by yourself.

      change their name or species.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - rscadd: Massively expanded the Vox Outpost for the benefit of the traders there
  - tweak: Changed the Courtroom significantly. You'll need to use the TV Monitors
      to watch the proceedings properly (won't be able to see judge from seats) but
      they broadcast speech and the seats, so it's functionally identical
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Borers can now inhabit a human's left arm, right arm, left leg, right
      leg, and chest in addition to their head. A human may have one borer in each
      of these limbs. The borer's available evolutions are influenced by the limb
      it is currently inhabiting.
2016-06-18:
  9600bauds:
  - experiment: The following changes required a lot of rewriting and refactoring
      of old-ass code. I've tested this as best as I could, but if you notice any
      bugs still, please don't hesitate to make a bug report!
  - rscadd: Trying to put an item in the wrong slot via the stripping menu now gives
      an explicit error message, so as to not waste your time.
  - tweak: 'Buffed the Pickpocket''s Gloves: Their effects now apply to all storage
      slots, not just ID and pockets.'
  - rscadd: You can now toggle someone's suit sensors via the stripping menu, without
      having to remove their jumpsuit.
  - tweak: There is now one unified option to toggle other people's internals via
      the stripping menu, which is available even if they have a tank in their pockets
      or hands.
  - tweak: 'Simplified the way toggling internals chooses a tank: It will now simply
      look in your suit storage, then back, then belt, then pockets, then hands. It
      will also only take internals from a jetpack as last option.'
  - bugfix: Fixed items in your pocket slots not applying their on_found() effects
      (e.g. mousetraps) when stripped individually, only when your jumpsuit was stripped.
  - bugfix: Fixed items in your pocket slots not applying their on_stripped() effects
      (e.g. SPS) when your jumpsuit was stripped, only individually.
  - rscdel: Removes the ability to perform CPR on alien larvas. Sorry guys.
  - bugfix: Accidentally fixed bug where you could spam CPR and do CPR multiple times
      at the same time in the same mob. Sorry guys.
  - bugfix: Fixed borers (or any other simple animals you can't control normally)
      never decreasing their deaf/confused/blind timers, thus being forever deaf/confused/blind.
  - bugfix: Borers will no longer be blinded by flashbangs if their host has flash
      protection (since they're seeing out of their host's eyes and whatnot).
2016-06-19:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed the first Xenoarch large artifact ever scanned becoming forever
      unmovable if a second large artifact was scanned afterwards or if the analysis
      was cancelled.
2016-06-20:
  DrCelt:
  - bugfix: fixes asspies to not contain spiritbreaker to bring behaviour like assburgers
  DrCelt / Intigracy:
  - bugfix: (DrCelt) Fixed a bug where species damage modifiers were applied twice.
  - tweak: (DrCelt) As a result of this, brute/burn modifiers are slightly less effective
      when it comes to resistance/weakness (less damage resisted, less damage taken,
      respectively)
  - tweak: (Intigracy) Dionae burn damage is an exception, it has changed from 6.25
      to 6.2
2016-06-21:
  Icantthinkofanameritenow:
  - bugfix: Fixed Vox Engineer hardsuit helmets lacking welding protection.
  - bugfix: Vox atmospherics hardsuits should protect against plasma exposure and
      fires like they're supposed to.
  JustSumBody:
  - rscadd: Watercoolers are no longer anchored by default. Made watercoolers and
      beerkegs wrenchable.
  Shadowmech88:
  - tweak: The utility borer's fleshshot now requires 10 chems to fire if the borer
      is using it to swing an item. It costs nothing if the host's hand is empty.
  - tweak: Utility borers are now incapable of using their fleshshot while their host
      is stunned, or has silicate in their system.
  - rscadd: Borers will now take damage while their host has sodium chloride in their
      system, and will die from it after roughly 40 seconds.

  - rscadd: Borers can now see their health in the status tab.
  - tweak: Plasmamen now take 1.5x brute damage.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added a new hostile monster - legionary hoppers. Their ability to leap
      on top of their foes makes up for their slower speed. The hostile infestation
      event can bring up to 8 of them to the station.
  - tweak: 'Tomb of Rafid updates:'
  - rscadd: Added a new area - the Water Gallery
  - bugfix: Fixed rock walls creating cold vacuum, fixed being able to crowbar water
      turfs
  - tweak: Slightly reduced damage done by fire blasts (affects fire traps, jackal
      firebreathers and pyromaniacs)
  - bugfix: Fixed cyborgs being able to use ladders. They can still enter the tomb
      through the second entrance
2016-06-22:
  DrCelt:
  - bugfix: Changed behaviour of grey telepathy to not be awful and highly exploitable.
  - tweak: You now have to hear someone speak locally - in other words, you have to
      see their speech bubble, before you can telepathically communicate with them.
  - tweak: The name chosen to represent them in the menu is the one you heard them
      speak as.
  - rscadd: If you examine someone they will be added to your options as well.
  - tweak: You can no longer discover if someone is dead by trying to send them a
      message.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Diona burn mod is now 2.5 again. Apparently the way burn mod was applied
      before wasn't as expected.
  Ririchiyo:
  - wip: added dectalk
  Shadowmech88:
  - tweak: Food items can now be loaded into the blunderbuss and the cannon. Drinks
      can as well, as long as the container isn't open.
2016-06-24:
  Sood:
  - rscadd: Aliens can now alt-click on mobs to spit neurotoxin at them.
  - rscadd: Aliens can now ctrl-click on other aliens to transfer plasma to them.
  - tweak: Spit neurotoxin now has a cooldown. Yes, it didn't before. That's how clunky
      that menu was.
2016-06-25:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed wallets hiding your identity when worn in your ID slot even if they
      had an ID put inside.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: There is now a more noticable difference between knives and kitchen knives
      now, the former is known as small knife and has a new icon. It still doesn't
      work for making swords.
  Shadowmech88:
  - imageadd: Added new borg sprites for the standard, service, security, and combat
      modules, courtesy of Dizor.
  Unid:

  JustSumBody:
  - rscadd: Quick equip will now prioritize placing items into equipped belts over
      pockets and suit storage.

  - rscadd: Players can click on the marker with their bare hand to become a necromorph,
      or drag another mob onto it to turn it into a necromorph.
  - rscadd: Ghosts can sign up to be a necromorph by clicking on the marker. They
      will take control of the next mindless necromorph to spawn.
  - tweak: Player necromorphs can now open doors.
2016-06-29:
  Kurfurst:
  - rscadd: Added three new Vox plants to fill missing botanical niches, Slippery
      Pitcher Plants, Aloe Vera, and Vapor Sacs.
  - rscadd: Added Box (plural Boxen), freakish boarlike livestock for Vox to farm.
  - rscadd: Added a Box Flesh Cloner and the Box meat it runs on, with which to clone
      fresh Box babies. Surely recloning the same meat again and again over untold
      generations won't cause the rise of some antediluvian horror.
  - rscadd: Added seven new Vox food recipes, bacon, pork tenderloin, sweet and sour
      pork, hobo burger, welcome pie, zhu long cao fan, poached aloe, mint, vapor
      stew.

      to turn reagents to gas.

      Contraband, Boxen starter kit added to Premium
  - tweak: Special thanks to all the spriters who contributed to the Vox hydroponics
      project, most prominently Inorien.
2016-06-30:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Reverse-stripping items into monkeys is instantaneous again.
  - tweak: Reverse-stripping items into humans is now 50% faster, since 4 seconds
      per slot is very tedious and the shorter time is not really very exploitable
      anyways.
  Kurfurst:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug with inheritance that caused woodapples to be reharvestable
      infinitely
  - tweak: Based on feedback, reduced vapor salt production significantly.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where any plant with images in hydroponics2.dmi would disappear
      when modified. These included diona nodes, Vox plants, cinnamonum.

2016-07-02:
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added blindness to the list of disabilities that you can give to your
      character in character creation.

  - bugfix: Phazon floors now affect all types of mobs, not only a few of them
2016-07-07:
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: The admin spawnable autogibber now actually works. I recommend not walking
      into it, trying to touch it with a tool, or trying to touch it with your hand.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Double agents now have a 20% chance to receive an objective to assassinate
      a civilian (non-antagonist). When such an objective is given, another double
      agent receives an objective to protect the civilian.
2016-07-10:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Added boot knife holsters. Currently, they can be found inside Security
      lockers, and come preloaded with a 10 force knife.
  - imageadd: Boot knife holster sprites courtesy of Blithering. Tactical knife sprite
      stolen from Bay when noone was looking.
  - tweak: The Biogenerator can now make handgun holsters, as well as the new boot
      knife holster.
  - tweak: Medals and ties can now be attached to spacesuits, armor, and anything
      that goes over your chest. Because why not?
  Faptastic:
  - rscadd: The service borg dice have been replaced with a digital die, change dice
      type via alt+click or yellow button.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Test firing a teleporter will now remove the 5% chance of spacing you for
      3 seconds.
  - tweak: Cult blades found through Xenoarchaeology no longer require you to be a
      cultist to use them. As a result, they also have only 15 force as opposed to
      30.
2016-07-13:
  PJB3005:
  - rscadd: Gave the tile painter the ability to clear decals on a tile.
2016-07-14:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to set someone else's suit sensors through a hardsuit.
      Also made the 'set suit sensors' button smaller to prevent accidental clicking
      when mashing every button on the strip menu after you stun that guy.
  kolith:
  - rscadd: Adds a secway vehicle. It behaves as a janicart, except that you crash
      into things and are stunned for a short time if you are clumsy or very drunk.
  - rscadd: Adds a foam armblade toy. It can be acquired as a prize from an arcade
      machine.
  ultraPLEN:
  - rscadd: Added modular couches contstructable from metal sheets.
  - bugfix: Fixed an overlay issue with roller chairs
2016-07-17:
  PJB3005:
  - bugfix: Fixes the R-UST and shield generator circuits being broken and unable
      to be built into machinery. You've got the author of Bus Station to thank for
      that.
2016-07-18:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed MoMMIs being able to drop held items while ventcrawling, which would
      make the dropped item magically pop out on the floor above the vent.
  JustSumGuy:
  - bugfix: 'The High-res camera module for Malf AI now once again lets you read lips
      as long as their mouth is unobstructed. '

      will get 10 plastic back.)
2016-07-22:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where limbs that had burn damage would not be severed from
      the body via brute damage. This was most commonly seen when trying to decapitate
      people that were lasered.
  - rscadd: Trying to put a brain in a MMI now produces a special message telling
      you to try again if the brain has ghosted but can still rejoin their body, much
      like how cloners work with corpses. When this happens, the ghosted player will
      get bwoinked and told to rejoin their corpse.
  - bugfix: Fixed the message you get when examining a brain, which was supposed to
      differentiate brains with a player still inside and brains belonging to a ghosted
      player.
  - bugfix: Fixed Diona nymphs not regenerating health from bright lights. Note that
      their health regen is much much slower than grown Diona. Did not 'fix' the way
      they take damage from darkness, meaning they still pretty much just don't.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Supermatter crates ordered from cargo now cost 500 credits, as opposed
      to 100.
  JustSumGuy:
  - bugfix: The 'Box Cloner' is now properly built from a machine frame rather than
      a computer frame.
  - tweak: Removed the overdose limit on imidazoline, and by extension carrots.
2016-07-24:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: All-in-One Grinders will now try to start grinding their ingredients when
      alt-clicked, and only eject their beaker if no ingredients are loaded (previously
      they would only eject their beaker).
  JustSumGuy:
  - bugfix: Made the food tray more like a table, add items to trays by clicking on
      the tray with the item in hand. Trays drop all their items upon being placed
      on a table,thrown, or dropped.
  mph55:
  - bugfix: Fixed an unreported bug which items removed from the switchtool were stuck
      on your hands after being picked up.
2016-07-27:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed Vox Raider dart guns not firing when clicking on a turf, which made
      aiming hell. Also, to prevent confusion and birdbrains unwittingly firing empty
      darts, the dartguns start mixing reagents by default.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - tweak: All chairs, wooden and metal, are now worth 1 sheet (both construction
      and deconstruction), down from 5/3/2/1 (Office, Wooden, Comfy, Normal)
  JustSumGuy:
  - tweak: Vampire's enthrall ability now requires both the vampire's and the target's
      masks to be removed. Enthrall can no longer be used while restrained.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added pop out cakes - enormous cakes that are big enough for a human to
      hide inside. Inside of it is a one use party string - pull it to sound the party
      horns and graciously climb out of the cake. Cutting them with a knife produces
      edible slices.
  - rscadd: Pop out cakes can be bought for 3 telecrystals by nuclear operatives,
      or cooked in the microwave using 15 milk, 45 flour, 6 eggs and 6 sheets of cardboard.
  mph55:
  - bugfix: The character preview is no longer blurry.
2016-07-31:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Trying to clone a husk now provides a more informative error message, rather
      than the generic 'mental interface failure'. This message also tells you if
      the dead guy can still rejoin their corpse, so you can try to clone a husk before
      attempting a head transplant and know you're not wasting your time on someone
      that already logged out.
  - spellcheck: Updated the in-game 'Cloning techniques of the 26th Century' book
      that spawns in Genetics so that it's not outdated by several years.
  - rscadd: Added pill color selection directly into the main menu of ChemMasters,
      to make it more convenient to switch pill colors.
  - rscadd: ChemMasters will now remember the last amount of pills and bottles created,
      making that the default input.
  - experiment: Some optimization that should hopefully fix ChemMasters taking a little
      while to open their window when used for the first time in the round.
2016-08-01:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: 'Fixed border firelocks often becoming locked when they shouldn''t, due
      to checking for pressure difference in air trapped behind windows (See: http://i.imgur.com/brVf2TN.png).'
  - bugfix: Also fixed border firelocks that were in the same tile as an airlock becoming
      locked when they shouldn't, due to checking the air 'inside' the firelock, rather
      than the air on the other side.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added some new sunglasses, fedoras and dunce caps.
  - rscadd: Added hat crates and glasses crates to cargo, both of them cost 50 credits
      and contain some ordinary hats and glasses (some of which are otherwise unobtainable).
  - rscdel: 'Changed Malf AI modules: Replaced Interhack (useless module) with Fake
      Centcom Announcement:'
  - rscadd: 'Fake Centcom Announcement: Buying it lets you create up to 3 centcom

      etc). Costs 15 units.'

  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Toolboxes can now hold normal-size items, just like backpacks.

      in a morgue tray, which explains what the morgue lights do.

      trays on their own.
  - bugfix: Fixed borgs becoming unable to move if they pressed Cancel when prompted
      to choose their appearance.
  - tweak: Changed the minimum metabolizable reagent amount from a constant 0.1 to
      the reagent's metabolism rate divided by 2. For nearly all reagents this will
      mean no change, reagents with a small metabolism rate will stop disappearing
      at 0.1u, drinks will require 0.2u rather than 0.1u minimum.
  - bugfix: Fixed cameras making people naked, hated every single second of trying
      to fix it. If you notice in-hand icons fucking up for any reason please don't
      hesitate to make a bug report.
  - bugfix: Firebirds now properly ignore airlock access always, not just for bolted
      or welded doors.
  - rscadd: Firebirds now fly through firelocks (same behavior as airlocks). They
      will also harmlessly fly through mobs.

      to the player who just joined
  Icantthinkofanameritenow:

      ID's in hand.
  Sood:
  - rscadd: Adds a new gamemode, Revolutionary Squad, which is a variant on revolution
      with an emphasis on a small, organized group of underequipped revolutionaries
      trying to kill the heads instead of a large group of gretiders.
  - tweak: Revsquad members only sometimes spawn with a flash capable of converting
      crew members, and it always has limited uses. They cannot use a standard flash
      to convert.
  - tweak: Adds the sawn-off shotgun as a defined type, which means it might get picked
      as random loot in places where guns are picked.
  - tweak: Adds pre-assembled IED as a defined type, similar to above.
  - tweak: Both revolution and revsquad requires at least 3 heads of staff to start.

  - rscadd: You can now upgrade spell power of Summon Robes. Upgrading it makes the
      spell summon a gem encrusted hardsuit with internals.
  - rscadd: You can now upgrade spell power of Shoe Snatching Charm. Upgrading it
      makes the spell summon 4 glass shards when cast on somebody who isn't wearing
      shoes (glass won't be spawned if the victim is wearing shoes).
  - rscadd: You can now upgrade spell power of Fireball. Upgrading it makes fireball
      targettable, shooting it wherever you click.
  - tweak: Several spells are now controlled by clicking on the spell and then on
      the target, instead of choosing a target randomly or bringing up a menu. Among
      these spells are Arse Nath, Clown/Mime/Horse curses, Blind, Shoe Snatching Charm,
      Subjugate and Controlled Fireball.
  - tweak: Player-controlled simple animals now move at the same speed as NPC simple
      animals.
  - tweak: Ranged attacks of simple animals (such as goliath tentacles, hivelord summons
      and spider queen web) can now be used by players.
  - rscadd: All objects are now subject to space drift, including vehicles. This means
      crates, lockers and janicarts will now fly off into space, instead of immediately
      stopping moving.
  - rscadd: Kicking something while in zero gravity will propel you in the opposite
      direction.
  - bugfix: Fixed being unable to eat some food by biting it

  - rscadd: Added a pair of magboots in the captains locker.
2016-08-14:
  Exxion:
  - rscadd: Added Wizard Wars admin event, accessible through the same button as Highlander.
      It's pretty much Highlander except with wizards. I recommend playing MAGIC MISSILE
      when you start it.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added MOVE, EXPORT and LOCK buttons to assembly frames. MOVE lets you
      change the order in which assemblies are displayed. LOCK prevents you from accidentally
      ejecting assemblies from the frame. EXPORT saves the assembly frame's data to
      a sheet of paper (must have a blank piece of paper lying on the ground).
  - rscadd: Inserting a sheet of paper with exported data into an empty assembly frame
      with all the required components on the same turf will instantly assemble and
      configure the frame!

2016-08-20:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: To prevent abuse, you may no longer holster weapons while they are in attack
      'cooldown' (same behavior as trying to put it in a container). Quickdraw not
      affected.
  - rscadd: Differentiated knife holster and handgun holster verb names so they can
      be used separately via the Object tab.
  JMWTurner:

  - imageadd: New in-hand sprites for the briefcase and satchel bag

      cost has gone back down to 10 credits. Guitars must also now be two-handed to
      play.
  Unid:
  - experiment: Added a new admin button to shuttle magic - it generates a transit
      area for the selected shuttle.
  kolith:
  - rscadd: Adds three new cyborg sprites. One for engineering, one for supply, and
      one for medical.
2016-08-22:

      for mapping.

      to unlock additional destinations.
  - rscadd: The biodome and listening outpost vaults now contain these disks. They
