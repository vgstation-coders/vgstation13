  kane-f:
  - rscadd: Crew score is now sent to IRC and discord
2021-04-24:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed even more chief cultist related critical bugs, including them being
      unable to operate cult doors at all, or getting targeted by hex constructs.
  - bugfix: Using a cult pamphlet when there is already a cult established does no
      longer turn the player into a second chief cultist.
  - bugfix: Constructs are now able to operate cult doors by clicking on them
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: Updated localization files.
  - tweak: Nanotrasen's Internal Affairs Agents are now provided with an object that
      allows them to identify each other in lower-light conditions, which is attached
      to the jumpsuit by default.
2021-04-25:
  help-maint:
  - rscadd: If you are gibbed while typing, you will say your last words right before
      you are disintegrated.
  - bugfix: Fixed some instances of forcesay (from open-hand-disarm-to-mouth, among
      other things) not working.
2021-04-26:
  Dacendeth:
  - tweak: Bags of holding create singularitys on the escape shuttle again.
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed roaches being dense and thus un-stompable
  - bugfix: Fixed bees being dense and thus unable to re-enter their apiary, leading
      to their hive's starvation and no honey production
  - bugfix: Lights on Test_Tiny are now all on from the start, and can never spawn
      broken
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: Siege cannons can now be converted to circus cannons with a clown's crayon
      or stamp.
  - rscadd: Clownnonballs can now be crafted out of 20 bananium sheets, God help us
      all
  - bugfix: Bugfixes bugs fixing their lack of radiation resistance
  Zth--:
  - bugfix: Fixes newscaster photos for linux
  help-maint:
  - rscadd: Conveyor belts will now automatically load lying patients into Cryo, Sleepers,
      Thermal Homeostasis Regulators and DNA scanners, if the conveyor is turned on
      and points directly into the machine.
  - rscadd: You can now set a custom output tile for Cryo and Cloners by using a multitool,
      similar to how it works for autolathes and other fabricators. When automatically
      ejecting patients, they will go to the custom tile instead of on top of the
      machine.
  kane-f:
  - tweak: Prisoner management consoles no longer file remote explosive implants under
      their own header
  - rscadd: Department suit storage units now require their access to lock/unlock
      suit storage units, must require a valid ID or emag to bypass
2021-04-27:
  robintime:
  - rscadd: adds plasmaman survival boxes with emergency plasma tanks (engineers,
      miners, and paramedics get an extended one)
2021-04-30:
  DeityLink:

      planned.

      normally.

      unable to deactivate it. THIS MEANS THAT BARTENDERS CAN FINALLY GET DRUNK.

      so you can close the shelf counter without locking yourself out of Botany.
  - rscadd: Added a Sink to Roidstation's kitchen
  - tweak: Nudged around a bit the items in the Bar's backroom on Roidstation to allow
      for easier pickup

      brands of cigarettes added almost a year ago.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Rocket-Dash mecha spell icon being blank
  - tweak: The Exosuit-Mounted Teleporter is now precise. Previously it had a 4-tile
      precision radius, meaning you could land anywhere in one of the 81 tiles (in
      a 9x9 area) surrounding the tile you clicked, which made it utterly unreliable
      on top of having a long cooldown. Often you'd even teleport right where you
      started from.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: RTGs and PDTGs malfunction if they get EMP'd or Ion'd, possibly losing
      max charge, self-charging speed or both.

  - rscadd: Insectoid, vox, and grey versions of assistant alt-title uniforms are
      now available

  - rscadd: Vending machines will use the price of pricetagged items loaded into them
      for vending
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: Head Revolutionaries now start with a megaphone, in addition to their
      current tools.
  help-maint:
  - rscadd: Added Midazoline, a chemical created with clonexadone, sulfuric acid,
      and gold powder, mixed in a jar that also contains 1 solid bar of plasma. Midazoline
      converts ALL chemicals it touches into more Midazoline. The exception is Mercury,
      which turns Midazoline into more Mercury.
  kane-f:

      at all costs!
  - tweak: Player controlled spiderlings now normally ventcrawl.

      pockets

  toomykins:
  - rscadd: you can now emag the randomize board for more interesting laws.
2021-05-01:
  ShiftyRail:
  - rscadd: Extended is back! It can roll depending on the threat level. If extended
      is rolled, no antags will spawn in the round until an admin decides so.
  gbasood:
  - tweak: Wizard's mutate spell no longer grants laser eyes.
2021-05-02:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed the Research Storage Room on Synergy not being connected to the
      power net.
  - tweak: The IV Drips in Synergy's Medbay are now next to the Refrigerated Blood
      Bank.
  - tweak: The Defibrillator Recharger in Synergy's Medbay is now next to the Defibrillator
      Locker.
  Eneocho:

  - rscadd: You can solidify diamond dust into diamond sheets via the solidification
      recipe (20u Diamond, 20u Silicate and 10u Frost Oil)
  - rscadd: You can mutate plain old carrots into diamond carrots, which have a bit
      of diamond dust inside (the same amount as a golden apple would have gold).

      suit storage slot in addition to botany items

2021-05-06:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed shades missing their Cult HUD when re-login into the game.
  - bugfix: Fixed Pipe Caps not properly connecting to pipes or being of the wrong
      color when painted. Not that they actually do anything beyond being cosmetic.
  - rscadd: Added Heat Exchanger Pipe Caps. Still cosmetic, still useless, those connect
      to Heat Exchanger Pipes. Use them if you want your pipes to look neat I guess.
  - imageadd: Fixed a few pipe sprites, namely Heat Exchanger Junctions have a new
      sprite as an item.
  - tweak: Re-arranged some of Boxstation's TEG setup. Removed some useless and redundant
      connectors, and swapped the CO2 canisters with some of the Plasma canisters
      from Engineering storage, so newbies don't get under the impression that CO2
      is meant to be the better choice for those gas loops. (A long time ago those
      were there to help stop fires that'd come out from the burn chamber but CO2
      clearly doesn't do anything in case of fire anymore)
  - tweak: Moved a bit the Blast Doors on Packedstation's TEG burn chamber so they
      are in view from the computers.
  - rscadd: If a Nuclear Operative spawns with some active gene, such as near-sightedness
      or fatness because of character setup, they will now receive a ryetalyn pill
      in their pocket to offer them the ability to get rid of those defects by themselves.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Detective Privacy Shutters button in the Detective's Office
      on LowfatBagel not doing anything.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Privacy Shutters button in the Captain's Quarters on Asteroid
      Station not working.
  Kurfursten:

  ShiftyRail:
  - rscadd: Medical staff now gets slightly better high-priority rewards.
  - imageadd: Picomed can sprites by Basil
  Zth--:
  - rscadd: Diona livers. They process whatever is ingested into a small amount of
      ammonia up to a maximum of 30 units.
  - rscadd: Added Transfer Reagents spell. A diona spell to transfer your reagents
      to a tray.
  - bugfix: Fixed NO_BLOOD species being able to drink infinite amounts of blood without
      consuming it from the container.
  - bugfix: Fixed NO_BLOOD species not processing blood (meaning they'd be stuck forever
      inside of reagents container)
  gbasood:
  - tweak: Fireball no longer creates heavy explosions, meaning it both deals less
      damage and will not breach floors.
  - tweak: Fireball now does double its previous damage to those in direct proximity
      to the explosion - enough for crit in one hit.
  help-maint:
  - tweak: Roundstart insulated gloves in Boxstation now spawn in a random location
      of their room, so Telesci cannot metagame them
  - rscadd: You can now stick chewed gum under chairs, and in the coin slot of vending
      machines. Stuck gum can be removed with screwdrivers or acid.
  - bugfix: Humans that don't have a brain, or have a detached brain, no longer feel
      pain.
  kane-f:
  - bugfix: Advanced reagent scanners no longer runtime when blood is detected in
      a non-blood mob

      mode
  robintime:
  - spellcheck: fixes the cap gun saying 'capss' instead of 'caps'
  - spellcheck: fixes the bug net saying beess (bees base species was already defined
      as plural)
  - spellcheck: fixes the monkey recycler not updating in the flavor text how many
      monkeys it still needs when upgraded
  - spellcheck: fixes magstomping using the gender of the stomper and not the victim
  - spellcheck: capitalizes 'Carp Pheromones' and drinks with brand names, decapitalizes
      very generic drinks like 'Paper Cup' and 'Cup Ramen' (juices and other such
      dispenser items unchanged)
  - spellcheck: you no longer 'take a gulp of Paper Cup'. you now 'take a gulp _of
      the_ paper cup'. this has been done with several different drinks, namely generic
      items that don't have proper names
  - spellcheck: added a period somewhere
  - spellcheck: bellow vs below
  - tweak: fixes the consistency issue of 'analyser' vs. 'analyzer'
  - tweak: double s's with a lisp no longer say 'thth', which is a sound no one makes,
      but 'thh'.
  - tweak: changes the mutation text to one consistent color, but italicized the plant
      names
  - tweak: vox in roles that use the engineering survival box now get an extended
      nitrogen tank and a vox mask, instead of an oxygen tank and a regular mask
  - tweak: greys in roles that use the engineering survival box now actually get the
      box
2021-05-10:
  ShiftyRail:
  - rscadd: Extended weight reduced my half
  beesil:
  - tweak: Ancient cryopod survivors now spawn with a random preset name, as well
      as a screen alarm to choose their name rather than an immediate prompt. Fixes
      cryopod survivors showing up as 'unknown' in deadchat.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: Some power-generating mecha equipment such as the Energy Relay, Plasma
      Generator and Nuclear Generator will be deactivated when the mecha is affected
      by an EMP.
  help-maint:
  - rscadd: Added leather belts as a leatherworking product. It has reduced storage
      slots, but gives you +4 strength and +4 stam.
  robintime:
  - tweak: egg yolks are now yellow
  - rscadd: sweetrolls can now be made in the microwave
2021-05-11:
  help-maint:
  - bugfix: Fixed that transplanting a head/brain onto the body of someone who had
      suicided would not let you revive them due to the game thinking they had suicided
      too. Also fixed being able to revive suiciders by headswapping them to a monkeyman
      body.
  kane-f:
  - rscadd: Constructable fuse bombs are here! Made with a surgical drill on an iron
      cannonball, welding fuel and cable coil, these are slightly more destructive
      than IEDs (without breaching) and can now be used as siege cannon ammo when
      lit!
  - tweak: Fuse bombs now light their fuse when caught in fires, like they should.
  - rscadd: Having spaghetti in your pockets will now cause you to spill it sometimes,
      bursting into treats not included.

2021-05-18:

      to a new, small, ugly triangle that tells you exactly how much space remains.
2021-05-19:
  ShiftyRail:
  - bugfix: Fixes things with dynamic mode
  help-maint:
  - rscadd: Added Locutogen, a chemical made from Piccolyn, Inacusiate, and Sugar.
      Locutogen will remember the first sentence it hears, and then replay that sentence
      in the head of anyone that eats it.
  - rscadd: Paroxetine (the chemical) now prevents you from suiciding, and will revert
      suicides if you can medicate someone with it before they die. No luck if they
      die before you get there though.
  kane-f:
  - rscadd: Applying a cryptographic sequencer to magboots will now disrupt their
      mag pulse attraction system. Use a solder to fix
2021-05-20:
  beesil:
  - rscadd: Adds World Bee Day to the list of holidays.
2021-05-21:
  Apogee-dev:
  - tweak: Adjusted med and mining hardsuit radiation armor values
  - tweak: Made the base rigsuit type less insanely radproof
  - rscadd: Brig medic alt title for paramedic. comes with medsec headset, loyalty
      implant, and outfit.
  - bugfix: Brig medics now protected from antag rolls like other implanted roles
  Eneocho:
  - spellcheck: Fixes many punctuation errors on corgi/Ian/Sasha's emotes.
  - rscadd: Adds a few emotes to some clothed Ian variants that had no emote.
  ShiftyRail:
  - bugfix: CWC is properly considered a round-ending rulesets and will not run concurrently
      with other round-ending rulesets.
  - bugfix: The Syndicate will now discriminate against magic users and blob-spore
      carriers once again. (You may no longer roll more than one antag at a time)
  Zth--:
  - bugfix: Fixes hulks not being able to resist cuffs while buckled
  help-maint:
  - tweak: Fridges now slowly cool items inside them. This serves no practical purpose
      and will virtually never be relevant or noticeable.
  - rscadd: You can now sudoku by suiciding with a pen while holding a blank piece
      of paper.
  kane-f:
  - rscadd: Antimatter control units, radiation collectors, disposals bins, P.A.C.M.A.N.s,
      R-UST fuel assembly ports, R-UST fuel injectors and portable air devices (such
      as canisters) now work with items loaded in via conveyors.
  - bugfix: Supermatter should now behave properly with conveyors.
  - rscadd: Dorf Station can now be voted for on August 8th, the anniversary of the
      release of Dwarf Fortress.
  - rscadd: Grey slime extracts are now available in crates from cargo
  robintime:
  - spellcheck: the centcomm link announcement no longer gives you secondhand embarrassment
2021-05-24:
  robintime:
  - tweak: the mailman uniform now properly lays on the body
2021-05-25:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: The Astral Journey cult rune has been completely reworked.
  - rscadd: Using the rune no longer sends the user into sleep, allowing them to move
      as soon as they interrupt the ritual.
  - imageadd: Improved the sprite generation of the cultified ghosts in general. The
      uniform and suit are now featured and partially truncated so only the upper
      body is visible.
  - rscadd: Astral projections can now toggle (with a 5 sec cooldown) between a tangible
      and an intangible state.
  - rscadd: While intangible (the default) astral projections can move around like
      ghosts as usual, see in the dark, and now passively have the Seer rune's convertibility
      HUD, allowing cultists to plan for potential converts to abduct from the safety
      of their base. But most importantly, when speaking while intangible the player
      will speak directly into cult chat, giving them the ability to help coordinate
      their peers with unprecedented efficiency.
  - rscadd: While tangible however, the projection becomes visible and looks just
      like the user. Even tricking examination and sechuds (medhuds however will not
      appear over their heads). They are fairly limited still when it comes to physical
      interactions, they can bump into doors and casually talk with people, but they
      are completely unable to pick up any item, press any button or pull any object.
      Furthermore they will get dispelled should they take the slightest amount of
      damage. Their role is to either allow the cult to safely converse with the crew
      after their identity has been exposed, or to cause mischief. And if nothing
      else, to spook the crew.
  - rscadd: In either state, the projection will be dispelled should you move it to
      another Z-Level, or should your body be moved away from the rune (or from the
      tile if it was triggered from a talisman). If your body dies while still on
      top of the rune, your shade will materialize at the current location of your
      astral projection.
  - rscadd: To complement those changes, cult hoods now have a button that lets cultists
      hide their face and voice, potentially giving them the ability to perform highly
      visible deeds without necessarily compromising their identity (as long as they
      don't forget to remove their ID).
  - bugfix: Engineering hard hats now have their sprite properly update on the player
      when toggling their light bulb.
  kane-f:
  - rscadd: Space stations now recognise international clown day
2021-05-26:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed antag-banned players still being able to apply for midround rulesets.
2021-05-27:
  west3436:
  - rscadd: Chicken Tenders now heal Janitors similarly to how sprinkles heal Security
      members.
  - tweak: Changed "Chicken Fillet" to "Chicken Tenders" for lore consistency.
2021-05-29:
  kafovofa:
  - bugfix: wolves no longer spend nutrition to regen while at full health
  - tweak: wolf regen from 1-3 -> 3 at less than half health and 1 -> 3 while well
      fed
2021-05-30:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed persistent crushed soda cans spawning with a blank name on subsequent
      maps.
  - bugfix: Players are now properly able to use the resist verb to escape the sticky
      webs from a Spider Queen's projectile, or a thrown Blood Dagger. Previously
      players had to click the trap, now both options are available as intended.
  - bugfix: Removed Component AI Spiders from the possible mob types that the Menagerie
      artifact effect can turn you into.
  - tweak: Removed the extra lightswitch in the bar backroom on Box, and moved the
      other light switch as well as the Kitchen's next to the door to their respective
      backroom, allowing the light to be toggled from either side in both areas.
  - rscadd: The Safe has had its functionality and UI refreshed a bit. Instead of
      bringing up an annoying html pop-up, clicking the Safe now brings up a radial
      menu featuring the safe's dial at the center and two buttons to rotate it. Immersion!
      Furthermore the Safe now opens by itself as soon as both tumblers are properly
      aligned and its contents will immediately appear on top of it. Clicking the
      safe while it's open with an item will place said item on top of it, while clicking
      it with an empty hand will close it, moving the items on top inside it, and
      randomize the tumblers' positions.
  - rscadd: You can now use a screwdriver on an open Safe to randomize the tumblers'
      unlock positions if you want.
  - tweak: The Safe's maximum capacity is now 30 items of any w_class, just like crates
      and closets, instead of its max capacity being limited by the items' combined
      w_class.
  - soundadd: The Safe now makes some sounds! A few brand new SFXs have been added.
  - bugfix: Fixed a very rare bug where the Safe's tumblers were set in a way that
      prevented players from ever cracking the Safe open.
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - rscadd: Revolutionaries can again trigger an announcement at a high enough conversion
      rate, leading to loud music to wake up the masses.
  jknpj:
  - rscdel: AIs can no longer use right click to examine turfs when they're outside
      their core view.
  kafovofa:
  - rscadd: The circuit imprinter can print thermal homeostasis regulator boards
  - tweak: Thermal homeostasis regulators are built with micro lasers instead of manipulators
  - rscadd: MEGAMADCRABs give crab meat when butchered.
  kane-f:
  - bugfix: Grey slime extract supply crates are now fitted the proper kinds of crates
      with locks, as they should be.
  - rscadd: 'New custom bar sign filter: Ripple.'
  - rscadd: Custom bar signs can now have their fonts and background color customised
      for each interval.
  - rscadd: Destructive analyzers, smartfridges, monkey recyclers, processors, fourier
      transform and hyperspectral analysers now all accept conveyor loaded items.
  robintime:
  - tweak: changes 'utility belt' to 'tool-belt' in the biogenerator menu
2021-06-04:
  Allspice:
  - bugfix: Re-add NATO alphabet language to deathsquaddies.
  Apogee-dev:
  - bugfix: Dynamic now checks alt titles in addition to job titles for protection
      & restriction from antag roles
  - rscadd: Medic armor vest, made by using a green crayon on a sec vest. Use bleach
      to return to original skin.
  - rscadd: Trauma Team hardsuit, currently only available by bus
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Organ Failure random events now have their own custom command alert instead
      of using a Biohazard Alert of random level (also more appropriate as there is
      no outbreak to contain here).
  - rscadd: The Biohazard Alert level during a viral infection event or viral outbreak
      event is now proportional to the actual combined danger of the disease's effects.
      It can be as low as 1, and all the way to 8 if the combined danger is 15 or
      16 which are the highest possible currently (disregarding adminbus). 9 as always
      is reserved for Blob.
  - bugfix: Fixed the admin buttons to "Toggle a Lights Out" or a "Prison Break"  not
      using the correct events.
  - bugfix: Fixed the admin option to create a new disease using an already existing
      pathogen displaying IDs only instead of the disease's full name.
  - bugfix: Fixed Admin-made pathogen not having the ID that was set by its creator.
  - bugfix: Fixed the admin "Trigger a Virus Outbreak" button not working.
  - rscadd: Admins can now trigger a custom outbreak event that will spread a previously
      prepared pathogen among the crew, and display the usual alert after some time
      as passed.
  - rscadd: Non-red blood in a drinking glass will now have a fake name slightly more
      believable than Tomato Juice.
  - rscadd: Added a couple new items to the Safe loot table.
  - bugfix: Fixed emitter goggles not working on mannequins
  - bugfix: Fixed glasses mapped onto mannequins not being properly equipped when
      the map loads
  - bugfix: Fixed items removed by monkeys from their backpack having a full-tile
      hitbox.
  - bugfix: Fixed humans no longer having bloody hands unless they're wearing gloves.
  - bugfix: Fixed surgery steps that should bloody your hands no longer doing so.
  - rscadd: The Write in Blood verb has been reworked. Both ghosts and humans now
      have it at all time under the Ghost and IC tab respectively. When using it you
      will attempt to write on your tile. Ghosts need to be either visible, or the
      cult must have reached the bloodstone phase. They will look for a blood splatter
      or footprint in an adjacent tile, if there are several they will get the option
      of which one to use, along with the source's color hex code. Humans however
      need blood on their hands or gloves and will use that one. You can preview your
      message before confirming like when using a crayon. There can be only one doodle
      per tile, and it carries DNA and color from the source blood. Also unlike the
      old bloody doodles, those are maptext'd, and can be read without being examined.
  - rscadd: Punching someone on a limb that is currently bleeding will splash their
      blood on your hands.
  - bugfix: Fixed dead mice still being able to nibble
  - tweak: Increased the layer at which remains appear. They appear now above tables
      but still below objects. As such they are no longer hidden by things like vents,
      scrubbers and pipe.
  - bugfix: When hitting someone with a weapon, should you miss the intended target
      limb and hit another limb, the chat will now correctly report which limb has
      been hit.
  - bugfix: Bomberman Spawns no longer invisible to ghosts who had darkness toggled
      off
  - bugfix: Bomberman Arenas no longer have their name in the corner set up incorrectly
      and showing up as literally just "name"
  - bugfix: Clothing in Bomerman Arenas  no longer remain on the ground after a round.
  - tweak: Reworked rag smothering to fix a few bugs. The new implementation requires
      you to target the rag at their mouth with a 1 second delay (a visible warning
      and SFX play as soon as an attempt is made). Species that do not breath cannot
      be smothered. People wearing smoke-blocking masks such as gas masks, internals,
      clown masks, surgical masks or cigarettes (if they're lit) cannot be smothered
      either. Upon success, all reagents inside the rag will be transferred inside
      the target (up to 5u).
  - bugfix: You no longer try to wipe down people that you are currently smothering
      or bandaging with a rag.
  - bugfix: You no longer try to wipe down the Sink when you fill up your rag.
  - tweak: Cultists now stop dancing while incapacitated, or when muted by holy water.
      This includes constructs when they are purged by a null rod.
  - bugfix: Cultists with the Chameleon gene no longer remain invisible while dancing.
  - rscadd: Cultists can now DANCE wherever using say "*cultdance". They will dance
      around the tile in front of them, so for the best looks do it in an open area.
      If other cultists uses the emote while adjacent to the first cultist's "dance
      center", they will join up and dance in sync. Up to 4 cultists may dance together
      without bumping into each other (as unlike the sacrifice/bloodstone dance, this
      one doesn't use forceMove)
  - tweak: You now need to be on help intent to reveal runes using a null rod. This
      means that you no longer get extra delay added to your attacks when using one
      to fight and missing by clicking the floor.
  - bugfix: Fixed mindless Wraiths appearing if you removed an amorphous mask that
      turns you into a Wraith when reaching the end of an Ethereal Jaunt.
  - experiment: Added a new Traitor Botanist uplink item, the Bee-Nade, which has
      been reworked to in fact spawn hornets that will immediately seek a target when
      they spawn. They also ignore the one who primed the spawner grenade, just like
      viscerators do. Cost 16 (Discount 8)
  - experiment: The Hornet Queen Packet traitor item has been replaced with a Deployable
      Wild Hornet Hive. Place it, throw it, drop it, but be careful as it cannot be
      picked up again once deployed. Those behave exactly like those from random events,
      except they spawn with less hornets inside, giving you a few seconds to get
      away before they start coming out. Cost 10 (Discount 5)
  - experiment: The swarm coming out of a Bee Briefcase now performs an attack as
      soon as it comes out of the briefcase, greatly increasing its lethal power.
      The TC cost has been slightly adjusted to match its increased lethality. Cost
      12 (Discout 6)
  - experiment: Bees and the likes now attack AFTER moving instead of before. This
      effectively increases their attack range, and so their dangerousness.
  - tweak: Bees that spawn from vermin infestations and hornets of all kind now immediately
      become angry again after their calmed status has expired instead of going back
      to their hive or to roaming.
  - rscadd: Bee and Hornet gatling guns bullets no longer deal direct damage, instead
      they immediately cause the spawned bug to attack once on impact. Said attack
      is also guaranteed to pierce bio or impermeable armors.
  - rscadd: Added a chillbug gatling gun. It doesn't deal damage of course but will
      inject 1u chillwax into players hit by the projectile.
  - rscadd: Added both the hornetgun and chillgun to Summon Guns.
  - bugfix: Bees and the likes can no longer attack through one-sided windows and
      windoors.
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to stomp snails when on harm intent.
  - bugfix: You can no longer convert the same mob several times (should they refuse
      and get restrained) to get additional progression on the Conversion objective.
  - tweak: Converting a mindless monkey (whether still monkey or human) will sacrifice
      them, leaving behind a coffer with a skull
  - bugfix: Space Heaters and Cult Forges can no longer heat up a room that's in a
      vacuum, causing mobs to take damage even though there is no molecules with which
      to exchange temperature.
  - bugfix: Fixed soul blades being offset both in the inventory and on the player
      when stored in the suit slot.
  - rscadd: All condiment bottles can have their content spilled over the floor if
      they are set to transfer 10 or more units. The amount spilled depends of the
      transferable amount set.
  - rscadd: Spilling 10 or more units of black pepper over the floor will create a
      cleanable mess.
  - imageadd: Tweaked the icons for salt piles and pepper mills.
  - rscadd: Added Holy Salts, a new reagent that can be easily produced by putting
      normal table salt in presence of a 5u catalyst of holy water. Just like salt,
      it will create cleanable piles when 10u of it are spilled over the floor.
  - rscadd: When salt piles are spawned, they now emit particles when they detect
      the presence of cult runes (even if concealed), talismans, tomes, and most other
      cult paraphernelia. After a set amount of time, the runes will be destroyed,
      the talismans and tomes will burn, and the other objects will break and melt
      away. The delay is 5 minutes for regular table salt, and 20 seconds for holy
      salts and starts when the pile is created.
  - rscadd: When a Path Entrance rune or a talisman attuned to a Path Exit rune is
      destroyed by a salt pile, a blood jaunt visible for a short duration will zoom
      toward the corresponding exit, giving the crew a hint as to the location of
      the Path Exit, and potentially a cult base. The jaunt will make a distinctive
      noise once it reaches the exit, letting any cultist near it at the time know
      that their base might be compromised.
  - rscadd: Added a couple more country flag-bearing mugs. Mug boxes such as those
      included in Cafe Equipment supply crates now include a random one each.
  - rscadd: Flag Mugs finally appear filled with liquid when some has been poured
      in them.
  - imageadd: Re-did the in-hand icons for mugs, and added some for all flag mugs.
      Mugs that contain a liquid that has a unique mug sprite no longer appear invisible
      in-hand, and instead use the default mug sprite.
  DrSnips:
  - bugfix: You can now use/work/hit windoors with basic tools again.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Adds plastic to the derelict MoMMI Material Synth.
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: Barbervends now sell scissors which allow actual barbering to take place.
  - rscadd: 4 new grey-specific rigsuits, 3 of which are available at cargo.
  - tweak: Egg cartons now have a small chance to come with a non-standard egg.
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: Hostile mobs are now able to break open firedoors and will fixate less
      on things they cannot reach.
  beesil:
  - rscadd: Adds red comfy chairs, standardizes comfy chair colors to match couches.
  kafovofa:
  - rscadd: Health analyzers highlight their heat reading in red if the target is
      too hot.
  kane-f:
  - bugfix: Ghosts no longer hide request console alerts
  - rscadd: All RCDs are now equipped with modules to transform compressed matter
      into windows and deconstruct them, unless made of plasma.
  - rscadd: Reagant dispensers, chemmaster derivatives, all-in-one grinders, microwaves,
      processors, seed extractors, biogenerators and xenobotany machines now work
      with conveyors.
  - rscadd: Mineral unloading machines are now buildable from circuit imprinters.
  - rscadd: Mineral unloading machines now have 3 matter bins and a capacitor, all
      upgradable for faster unloading and lower power usage.
  - rscadd: Mineral unloading machines can now have their directions tweaked with
      a multitool with ease.
  - rscadd: Mineral unloading machines work like conveyors on machines on the other
      end.
  - tweak: New common mineral machine item, cutting down a lot of redundant code and
      variables.
  - rscadd: Wizards have now learned Curse of the Hangman, a spell obscuring the letters
      in others' spoken words. Cure this by guessing the missing letters, but don't
      make mistakes, or it will reset!
  robintime:
  - spellcheck: punctuates several flavortexts
  - spellcheck: '''this the reinforced wall'' now just says ''the reinforced wall'''
2021-06-05:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed reagent splashing from beakers.
2021-06-06:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Egun beams now have their alpha reduced proportionally to their damage
      when they get dispersed by windows.
  - bugfix: beams no longer lag when firing through a large corridor or into space.
  - bugfix: Fixed full-tile windows not reducing beam damage. It now does it with
      the same efficiency as a single directional window.
  - bugfix: Firing beams straight through a tile featuring directional windows will
      no longer reduce its damage if the window isn't oriented toward (or away) from
      the source of the beam (which means that in most cases, if the beam crosses
      a tile with a window without intersecting with it, it shouldn't lose some of
      its damage)
  - bugfix: Fixed players losing space parallax upon turning into Shades.
  - bugfix: Fixed beams not going through windows facing the other way.
  - bugfix: Fixed beams dealing 0 damage never disappearing.
2021-06-07:
  Apogee-dev:
  - tweak: Makes replicator mommi's emagged eyes red
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Mature Space Vines (kudzu) will now properly spread when an adjacent door
      opens or an adjacent wall is dismantled.
  - bugfix: Fixed Biomass spreading through one-directional windows and firelocks.
  - bugfix: Fixed a very rare bug (actually I've calculated that it had a 4.5 percent
      chance of occurring which isn't THAT rare) where the Safe's tumblers were set
      in a way that prevented players from ever cracking the Safe open. But this time
      for real. No really, I've tested it with extreme values and all that.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Atmospheric Alert Computer appearing to be invisible when broken.
2021-06-08:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused challengers to spawn with no objectives if their
      target was the Trader.
  - rscadd: When cloned you now keep the default language you had when you were scanned.
2021-06-09:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added the white chicken suit I sprited back in 2015 and forgot to actually
      PR all this time. A single costume can be obtained from the AutoDrobe after
      inserting a coin.
  - imageadd: Improved the chicken suit and head in-hand icons.
  - rscadd: Humans have a few new emotes. ok/okay makes an OK sign, thumbup/thumbsup
      makes a thumbs up, thumbdown/thumbsdown makes a thumbs down, and peace makes
      a peace sign.
  - rscadd: Added hand count requirements for those emotes. Having your hands broken
      or amputated will make you unable to perform them.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: On the most foolish of days of the year, janitors lose their income, toiling
      for no monetary compensation.
2021-06-11:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: The scoreboard of the previous round can now be checked at any point by
      clicking the Last Round Information button that is now always available in the
      top right (until the current round ends)
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - rscadd: Adds a fully dysfunctional station for dorfmode events. Room for both
      chilling out in caves and building a functioning station. Includes a derelict
      ship mapped by BurntDevil.
2021-06-12:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed the right panel being much smaller than normal (hopefully)
  - bugfix: You can no longer write in blood as a ghost if the source blood disappeared
      before you finished writing your message.
  - bugfix: You can no longer write in blood if there is no blood left on your hands
      or glove by the time you finish writing your message.
  - tweak: Ghosts can now only write in blood up to a certain amount of tiles from
      the original blood source (before they could daisy-chain messages ad nauseam).
      The max distance depends of the original source's amount of blood. A drip will
      only have a radius of 1. Splatters a radius of 2. Gibs a radius of 5. (Same
      distance as footprints)
  - tweak: Projectiles now have a 75 percent chance of hitting mobs in cages, as long
      as the cover is up.
  - rscadd: Just like artificers can click floors up to 3 tiles away to convert them
      into cult floors, they can now click space tiles to conjure floors over them.
      As when done by clicking the spell button, conjuring a tile instead of converting
      one leads to a longer cooldown.
  - bugfix: Fixed mapped alien embryos not spawning a dead alien larva. Expect to
      find a few dead larvas hidden on some maps.
  - rscadd: All playable mobs now have standardized damage overlays which should help
      players controlling simple_animals noticing when they're taking damage.
  - bugfix: Fixed the brute and oxy damage overlays going away for a second then coming
      back when dying. Those overlays also now come back instantly when re-entering
      a corpse.
  - bugfix: Patched an exploit that allowed players to unload ore boxes using the
      pop-up window from any distance away or even adjacent but otherwise incapacitated,
      which apparently allowed a few people to mess with our shaft miner friends.
  - bugfix: Also fixed ore unloading machines causing all ore boxes in their area
      to dump everything every second, instead of only those in front of them.
  - experiment: Dynamic ruleset picking had its pseudo-RNG tweaked to now consider
      not just the previous round, but all 3 previous rounds, decreasing the odds
      of a ruleset being picked again in a short timespan. The odds are reduced more
      if the round was more recent, and if it fired several times in the previous
      three rounds the odd reductions will stack up. This should help prevent having
      the same ruleset firing several times in a short timespan.
  - experiment: Although note that rulesets that fire when the round was already about
      to end will NOT affect future rounds' ruleset weights.
  - experiment: Syndicate Traitors, both roundstart, latejoin, and midround, are also
      always exempt from this weight reduction.
  - experiment: Primetime rulesets now have lowered threat requirement, which should
      allow them to actually fire if the pop allows it but the Threat is average.
      Basically this means that Blob Tuesdays can finally be a thing. Also note that
      this doesn't affect low pop (if the threat requirement is 90, it will remain
      90 in most cases)
  - bugfix: The holomap on from the PDA Station Holomap app now properly updates when
      moving aboard a vehicle.
  - rscadd: The round end scoreboard now indicates which potions were bought by a
      wizard.
  - bugfix: Fixed scoreboard icons either missing or being wrong.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: Makes the mouser fit inside the handgun holster.
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - tweak: Fixed an exploitable thing and added dorf mommi spawners to dorf.
  kane-f:
  - tweak: Compressed matter implants now only store the activation emote in the memory
      of the implanter instead of the implanted, as with other traitor implants.
  - bugfix: RCDs can no longer be used on windows to remove mysterious invulnerable
      grilles.
2021-06-14:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Removed the random wall vent hidden under a sign at Packedstation's Chemistry
      lab.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where player-controlled zombies could attack while double
      dead (given that zombies are already dead and when you shoot one enough it becomes
      double-dead, although this time two negatives don't turn into a positive)
  - rscadd: Added a new spell for the ancient spellbook, Card Trick! Guess what someone's
      card is and their inventory will completely fill up with the copies of the card!
  - bugfix: '"A card" not "card" description for playing cards.'
2021-06-15:
  DamianX:
  - tweak: Extended can no longer fire with fewer than 30 players.
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Cyborgs still being able to roll Challenger, again.
2021-06-16:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Delivery Chutes not activating if items where inserted via conveyor
      belts.
  - rscadd: Dorfstation now features a defective cloning pod among the other ancient
      cryogenic pods. Ghosts of players who died can click it at least 10 minutes
      after they died to respawn as if they came out of a cloning pod. However this
      means respawning with clone and brain damage, and a guaranteed genetic disability.
      Therefore you can decide for yourself whether to wait and preserve your identity,
      or respawn with a new identity from an ancient cryo pod. Alternatively, wait
      for the crew to set up medbay with a proper cloning pod.
  - rscadd: Added new mannequin types! Using either a marble (obtainable from cargo)
      or wooden (craftable) block, you can now sculpt a human woman, or a corgi. Said
      corgi mannequins can wear items just like real corgis do.
  - rscadd: Spessmen have gotten better at sculpting mannequins, and can now sculpt
      their hair and beards.
  - rscadd: Mannequins mobs, such as those that can be found on the drone ship, or
      created by wizards using a staff of animation on a mannequin, are now able to
      fire the guns in their hands, and benefit from the armor they are wearing.
  - tweak: Flesh to Stone now turns humans, vox, monkeys and corgi into marble mannequins
      instead of statues. This means that items can be attached on them or removed,
      but also that when hit by a bolt of animation, they will fight using the items
      in their hands and benefit from the armor that they are wearing.
  - tweak: Apetrine no longer kills or makes unclonable the mobs trapped in a statue
      if said statue was mostly undamaged (if the mob's HP were above 50 when they
      got trapped) although they will still take a fair bit of damage and might die
      shortly after if not given medical care.
  ShiftyRail:
  - tweak: You can now place mounted frames on top of full-tile windows or directional
      windows oriented in a way to support the light frame.
2021-06-17:
  robintime:
  - rscadd: adds a special box to spawn equipment on dorfstation
  - rscadd: adds an unobtainable, nonreactive version of medcores called hardcores
2021-06-20:
  Allspice:
  - rscadd: Add an ordinary green balloon to the AutoDrobe (requires coin)
  Apogee-dev:
  - bugfix: EMPing a mech now actually EMPs its cell
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: The traitor mime hand-gun's bullets no longer cause shrapnel to appear
      out of thin air.
  - rscadd: The Ore Unloader has had both its appearance and mechanics slightly refreshed.
      It now plays an animation when it forces an ore box to dump its content and
      another one when grabbing items. The new sprite was designed to fit along nicely
      with conveyor belts, and kept the original machine's color scheme.
  - bugfix: Fixed Ore Unloaders not emptying ore boxes.
  - tweak: Pianos, Space Minimoog and Xylophones that come out of the random instrument
      or big band instrument collection supply packs are no longer anchored and can
      be immediately pulled around.
  - tweak: Hydroponic Trays found inside mining surprises on the asteroid no longer
      spawn anchored.
  - bugfix: Dismantling a machine containing more than 50 sheets of a given material
      type now properly gives several sheet stacks.
  - bugfix: Fixed Forgotten Cult Hoods (the red ones) turning into regular cult hoods
      when picked up.
  - experiment: Photography Camera had their underlying mechanics thoroughly reworked,
      which should have fixed most bugs related to them, including some objects being
      invisible, having the wrong orientation, mannequins not wearing clothes on pictures,
      etc...
  - bugfix: Fixed clothing being offset on cyber mannequins.
  - bugfix: Mice and other no-damage animals clicking inflatable shelter will now
      nuzzle them instead of attacking them in vain.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Pitbulls spell icon appearing quite strangely on the round end
      scoreboard.
  - imageadd: Abandoned mining crates now have a dusty look.
  - bugfix: Conveyors belts no longer send items through one-direction windows and
      obstacles if there's a receiving machine such as a disposal chute on the other
      side.
  - tweak: When failing a surgery step because you were operating on a table, or a
      regular roller bed, you will now trigger an actual surgery step failure instead
      of attacking the patient with your tool.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: Irradiated Beans, Re-Fried Beans, Mutated Beans, Off-Color Cheese, Greenish
      Ramen Noodles, Glowing Ramen Noodles, Deep Fried Ramen Noodles, Horse Meat and
      Beff now have a nutrition value.
  - tweak: Irradiated Beans, Greenish Ramen Noodles and Glowing Ramen Noodles have
      a chance to irradiate when metabolizing.
  - tweak: Toxic Waste, Mutated Beans and Greenish Ramen Noodles have a chance to
      poison when metabolizing.
  - tweak: Moon Rocks has a chance to cause brute damage (Because it hates the human
      skeleton) when metabolizing.
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - rscadd: Added a suit storage unit for Trauma Team rigsuits as well as a pair of
      matching magboots, so adminbus and mappers can have some more versatility with
      apogee's cool designs.
  ShiftyRail:
  - experiment: A new lighting system is used in place of Goonlights.
  - rscadd: This system is darker, with objects casting shadows.
  - rscadd: 'It allows for many effects: flickering of light sources, objects glowing
      in the dark, more control on the shape of light sources, etc.'
  - rscadd: Some objects - supermatter shards, AME cores, glow in the dark.
  - rscadd: Firecamps emit more light.
  - rscadd: The system is lighter on the server than goonlights.
  - bugfix: This new system fixes the problem of goonlights bleeding over walls.
  - experiment: 'All maps have been heavily reworked to accommodate for this new system.
      Your feedback is requested on this new lighting layout: report anything that
      may appear out of place.'
  SonixApache:
  - rscadd: agent cards can now be disguised as cargo cards
  - bugfix: mapped corpses now have the correct ID card icons
  TGFH:
  - rscadd: X, Y, Z coordinates added to the ingame comms console logs
2021-06-21:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: Added a brand new midround ruleset, become a spiderling as part of
      a spider infestation. Terrorize the crew, and above all, break every light you
      come across!
2021-06-22:
  DamianX:
  - bugfix: Doctor's Delight will now be properly highlighted when it's a syndicate
      code word.
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed the numpad no longer letting you type numbers.
  - tweak: To change which zone you're targeting using the numpad, you now have to
      hold the ALT key down at the same time (except for hands and feet that still
      require you to hold down CTRL)
  - tweak: Hostile mobs no longer destroy firelocks that are either open, or welded
      down.
  - imageadd: Headcrab zombies have a new sprite looking more akin to their HL2 counterparts,
      including also a clothed version used when the zombie is spawned by other means
      than an actual headcrab, such as gold slimes or amorpheous masks.
  - bugfix: Fixed multiple bugs linked to headcrab zombie death, including deadly
      lag occuring when an amorphous mask wearer transmogrified as one gets killed.
  - rscdel: Facehuggers and Headcrabs no longer try to sneak themselves among other
      articles of clothing at Spessmart.
  - rscadd: Bomberman Suit and Head now have a chance to be found at Spessmart (for
      purchase of course).
  - rscadd: Clumsy people using a zippo have a chance to set themselves on fire with
      class when lighting their cigarette or a campfire.
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where only one challenger would spawn instead of the minimum
      of two if less than ten players readied-up.
  - experiment: The goon satellite vault has a new unique reward in its display case.
      Though you can still find the goon code tossed on the floor beside it.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: The Biogenerators can make extra slime bags as an alternative source of
      said bags.
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: 'New wizard spell: Invoke Emotion.'
  - tweak: Gourmongers are less prone to random fits of starvation and can no longer
      gmod phase through things.
  - tweak: Gourmongers now say "BorrrboRRrygMMmmmus" when close to starvation
  Optimism333:
  - imageadd: Updoot to the old Grayy spacesuit sprites, descriptions, and statistics.
  - imageadd: Update to the sprites of the Space Grayy hostile humanoid.
  - tweak: Changed the blue oxygen tank the hostile Space Grayy humanoid drops on
      death to red to match the new sprite.

      multitool buffers now.
  SonixApache:
  - rscadd: added buttons for admins to turn all lightswitches on/off (ALL of them,
      on ALL z-levels)
  gurfan:
  - bugfix: Fixed the FTL ship vault spawning multiple times.
  kane-f:
  - tweak: Plague mice now have information about their disease stored in their mind.
  - spellcheck: Vox Dormatories are now spelled correctly.
  - rscadd: Role panels and examinations on antagHUD now show information about traitor
      items bought
  slightly-floating:
  - rscadd: 'There''s a new juke playlist now: 90''s IDM. Check it out.'
2021-06-23:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Wild beehives can once again only be harvested by breaking them apart,
      and they no longer drop a tray and place-able apiary out of thin air.
  Eneocho:
  - spellcheck: Fixes the nuke option command alert against blob/benos saying "possibile"
      instead of "possible".
  - tweak: Changes the greymlin vermin text from "gremlin assistant" to "greymlin".
  beesil:
  - rscadd: Adds some new surprises to the asteroid. Become a shaft miner today!
  kane-f:
  - tweak: Turret code has been standardised and slimmed down greatly
  - bugfix: Turret ID panels now properly apply lethality settings rather than having
      them inverted.
2021-06-24:
  kane-f:
  - rscadd: 'Introducing Space Hobos: A ghost role with even less responsibility,
      access or power than Traders! Non-crew members of any race spawn in a shack
      in an asteroid free to explore as much as they want, or forge their own destinies
      with nearby stations...'
  - rscadd: Traitor mimes can now purchase a spellbook teaching them how to conjure
      invisible un-walls. When active on a tile, mimes can cross over anything on
      it regardless of density.

  Apogee-dev:
  - rscadd: Crate & chest mimics can be wrapped and shipped over disposals.

      bleeding arms, legs, hands or feet.

      you're not wearing any gloves. The future is looking bright for chaplain cultists.

      job-exclusive uplink items.
  - rscadd: If you got a dormant gene at roundstart or latejoin and it activates,
      you now get some flavor text informing you about it.

      hard to find.
2021-07-03:
  Apogee-dev:
  - tweak: Mech Beacon "self-destruct" changed to "overload"

      inside pockets.
  - experiment: Giant Spider vision has been reworked, fixing transparency issues
      among other things.
  - experiment: Catulism Syndrom (stage 3) now actually provides much improved vision
      in the dark. Tajarans also benefit from it by default. Incidentally, so can
      other human species should they have tajaran eyes implanted through surgery.
  - experiment: Mushroom people also see better in the dark by default, but not quite
      as good as Tajarans, however their genetic spell now lets them switch to a different
      mode of perception that let's them see even better in dark areas than lit ones.
  - experiment: Lastly Constructs can also see a bit better in the dark, although
      with a red tinge.
  - rscadd: Animals with wings can now use the flap and aflap emotes.

  Apogee-dev:
  - rscdel: Removed robotics access from the Scientist job.
  - tweak: Removed access requirements from the mechfab.
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Hobo shacks are now hidden on the minimap.
  - rscadd: Added some admin buttons allowing them to manually toggle off random events
      or dynamic rulesets. Both rulesets and events can still be forced manually by
      admins while the toggle is off.
  - tweak: The Research Outposts airlocks on box, roid, and metaclub, all feature
      a second large dual-port vent, which should cut down by half the time it takes
      for the air to cycle.
  - rscadd: Box's Research Outpost's scrubber loop now actually filter the O2 and
      N2 back into their tanks at the Research Outpost Atmospherics instead of just
      throwing it into space.
  - tweak: Moved the O2 Canister in the Mining Outpost's airlock back a room so it
      stops getting ZAS'd outside.

  - bugfix: Fixed Security/Medical Record Pictures of non-humans having them look

      the agent who bought the belt as intended.
  - tweak: Mobs in capsules no longer have a chance to perform their random emotes
      or say their random lines. Rogue Drones in capsules also no longer emit sparks
      randomly.
  - bugfix: Fixed Hex spawned by the Master Trainer Belt having invisible lights
  - bugfix: You no longer share contact diseases with someone after a punch or disarm
      that missed.
  - bugfix: Biting and Kicking can now properly transmit contact diseases, checking
      sterility on your feet instead of your hands in the case of kicking, and bypassing
      bleeding checks (and sterility checks on your own face) in the case of biting,
      which means that you can now bite people to transmit them your own (or get their)
      blood-only diseases (still needs to pass the sterility check on the target as
      well as the infection chance roll though). This applies to monkeys as well since
      they always attack by biting, but not to mice whose teeth aren't quite big enough.
  - bugfix: Fixed the borer development lab's airlocks being called borer devolopment.
  bathosbathtime:
  - rscadd: Bartenders and detectives no longer spawn with their inactive genetic
      defects activated
  gurfan:

  kane-f:
  - rscadd: Blacksmithing forges can now smelt ores, one pile at a time. (except plasma,
      the fuel)

      entire parent ore processor object, for more flexibility.
  - rscadd: Bikehorns now go off when you step on them.
  - rscadd: Centcomm and syndicate console messages as well as faxes are now logged,
      and sent to non-playing admins along with prayers.
2021-07-12:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added wristwatches to the game, a new uniform accessory. Their hands move
      in real time on their sprite, and you can click it to get the current station
      time down to the second. Can be purchased from the merch computer at the Cargo
      Lobby.
  - rscadd: They can also extremely rarely be found from maintenance loot spawners,
      and tourists coming out of Ancient Cryopods have one equipped as a reference
      to the old long-time layering glitch that caused their right arm to appear to
      wear a red strap.
  - rscadd: Captains spawn with a unique golden wristwatch. Although there is a small
      chance of getting another one from the Vault's safe.
  - rscadd: There is also a sleek black variant that can be rarely found from maint
      spawners. Nuclear Operatives spawn equipped with those, as time is of the essence
      in their field.
  - rscadd: Finally a pocket watch variant can be dug up frome house/dwellings digsites
      on the asteroid. Let your local xenoarchaeologist know if you're interested
      in getting one.
  - imageadd: Special thanks to terrel for providing the gold, black, and pocket watch
      sprites.
  - rscadd: Added a new machine, the Photo Booth. Can be entered by just walking inside
      from the front, clicking it while inside will buckle you in there for a few
      seconds, then after a few seconds an ID photo will pop out of the machine. There
      will be at least one on each map, until then you can build them from R&D. You
      can also Alt Click the booth to select one of several backgrounds.
  - rscadd: ID Photo are a new subtype of photos. Just like regular photos you can
      write on them, use them on newscasters, but more importantly, when using them
      on a Security or Medical Records computer open on a given entry, you can scan
      the photo on the computer to update the entry's photo. Until now, new records
      created at a Security Computer were damned to never have any picture, this changes
      at last!
  - rscadd: Added scissors. They're basically just wirecutters with a different sprite.
      You can print them at an autolathe from the Misc Tools category. You can use
      them (or any type of wirecutter) on an ID photo to split it into 4 regular photos.
      Those individual photos CANNOT be used to update records.
  - bugfix: Fixed the same player being picked several times at once to be a wizard
      during Civil War of Casters, and ending up with more Spell Books at their disposal
      while other players get cucked out of their antag roll.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Plant-B-Gone stops dionae healing from light.
2021-07-14:

      will periodically lose some of their teeth and start talking like a pirate.
  - bugfix: Fixed the photo booth board appearing in the wrong category and printing
      a teleporter console board instead
  - bugfix: Mice (both observers and plague mice) will no longer spawn in the supermatter
      chamber, as well as in Virology or Xenobiology if their vents aren't connected
      to the rest of the station.
  - tweak: Getting disfigured now causes your hair and beard to no longer appear.
      Getting decapitated while disfigured causes the spawned head to be labelled
      as a disfigured head.
  - bugfix: When infected with several diseases all featuring the same symptoms that
      activate when touching or bumping into someone (namely Porokeratosis Acanthus
      and Epidermolysis Bullosa), only the first instance of each symptom type will
      activate per bump. So no more crit'ing people in a single bump while infected
      with 50 duplicates of the same disease, that symptom is deadly enough on its
      own already.
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: Centcomm Encryption Keys are now called Syndicate Encryption Keys in the
      Uplink Menu.
  - rscadd: The Syndicate Encryption Keys now grant access to the Syndicate radio
      channel in addition to all the usual channels.
  kane-f:
  - tweak: Manifest predictions in pre-game lobby are now sorted by department.
  - bugfix: Manifest prediction CSS now displays properly.
  - tweak: The shack area has been shrunk from 12x12 to 10x10.

      feature. Rightclick on the RPD to toggle
  - rscadd: Metal Slime Extract can be applied to an RPD to enable multilayer building.
      Rightclick on the RPD to toggle
  - rscadd: Black Slime Extract can be applied to chemistry dispenser to make creating
      doctor's delight a little easier
  - rscadd: Blue Slime Extract can be applied to foam fire extinguishers to make them
      really cold
  - rscadd: Orange Slime Extract can be applied to a pepper spray to make it refill
      automatically
  - rscadd: Oil Slime Extract can be applied to any pickaxe or drill to make it mine
      in an AoE
  - rscadd: Bluespace Slime Extract can be applied to a socket wrench, allowing it
      to vent the excess gas into space, instead of into the room
2021-07-15:
  kane-f:
  - bugfix: Newscasters no longer delete their photos from existence when made into
      frames.

  DeityLink:
  - rscdel: You no longer have a chance to find certain types of coins when excavating
      a digsite.
  - rscadd: The radiations emitted by radstorms are now also harvested by radiation
      collectors and antimatter decelerators.
  - bugfix: Fixed issues where you could buckle ghosts and other non-tangible mobs
      (such as an AI holopad's virtualhearer) by using a coffin's AltClick property.
      Observers could also unbuckle mobs buckled inside coffins, and anyone could
      do it at any distance.
  - tweak: Buckling and Un-buckling from a coffin is now done via mouse-dragging,
      just like in a sleeper. AltClicking does nothing anymore, and clicking toggles
      normally the coffin open or closed. On that note, you can now properly close
      coffins while people are buckled in them.
  - bugfix: Fixed being unable to put cardboard in a microwave if there was only one
      sheet in the stack.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Baby carp cubes and baby carp cube boxes, currently adminbus only.
  - rscadd: Carp Pheromone 30u bottles. Currently adminbus only.
  - imageadd: Carp coloured box for the carp cubes, for ease of recognition.
  kane-f:
  - bugfix: Cloning now also properly clones attack logs for admins.
  - tweak: Hyperzineandrelatedchemicalsnowmakepeopletalklikemotormouths.

  DeityLink:

2021-07-19:
  Apogee-dev:

      independent jobs.
  - rscdel: Removed xenoarch and xenobio-related alt titles from the Scientist job
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added a screen alarm button that players can click when buckled to a coffin
      to unbuckle themselves, similar to when buckled to a chair or bed.
  - bugfix: Fixed Traitors not having access to their role exclusive uplink items
      (namely the coop items)
  - bugfix: Using the Summon Robes rune now closes any suit or webbing inventory currently
      open.
  DrPainis:
  - rscadd: Space Asshole's Day is now celebrated on October 25th
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - tweak: Many speech filters are now converted to regex speech_filter datums.
  - rscadd: Wordfilters are more fun now in general.
  kane-f:
  - rscadd: Proximity sensors now have a choice on repeating their pulses when someone
      is nearby (the old and default) or on people entering or exiting.
  - rscadd: Timers now have the option to only pulse once when the timer runs out
      (the old and default) or reset the counter and pulse once it runs out repeatedly.
2021-07-20:
  Apogee-dev:
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue causing xenoarchs to spawn without their uniforms.
2021-07-21:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed the game thinking you have no hands if you tried swapping hands
      while handcuffed, after getting un-handcuffed.
2021-07-23:
  Apogee-dev:
  - rscadd: File cabinets, weight machines, and wooden cabinets can now be built out
      of 2 metal, 2 plasteel, and 2 wood respectively, and can be disassembled with
      a welder (file cabinet, weight machine) or a crowbar (cabinet).
  - rscadd: Secure cabinets can now be made by adding airlock electronics to a wooden
      cabinet.
  - tweak: While open, secure cabinets (detective, bar, wondrous wardrobe) can now
      be dismantled into wood and airlock electronics with a crowbar instead of welded
      into metal like a normal secure locker.
  - tweak: Weight machines can now be anchored and deanchored with a wrench.
  DamianX:
  - tweak: All job preferences have been reset because the way they are stored in
      the database has changed.
  - bugfix: Right-clicking any other job in the preferences window while there was
      a job set to "high" no longer sets that "high" job to medium.
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Substantially increased the chance for Wizarditis to spawn wizard clothing
      after the symptom has activated 60 times.
  - tweak: Also increased the chance for Wizarditis to cause spell casting from 3
      percent per activation to 20 percent.
  - tweak: Magnitis has been buffed quite a lot from the near-invisible symptom it
      was until now. The Symptom no longer has to pass two probability checks to activate
      instead of one. Its area of effect has also been increased by 1 tile for each
      three levels of intensity (which increases after the first 10 and 20 activations,
      to 3 tiles, to 6 tiles, to 9 tiles.)
  - experiment: A satellite has been observed drifting through Nanotrasen space which
      is believed to be the testing grounds of a new experimental type of AME. Whatever
      tests were done there appear to have stopped and the satellite was evacuated
      in a hurry. The satellite itself was deemed too unsafe to properly decommission
      so it is still drifting through space to this day. Regardless, do not go near
      it. Do not board it. And by all means Do Not try to resume the experiments that
      were happening there.
  - bugfix: Fixed NO_BLOOD human species still creating blood splatters when getting
      ZAS-slammed.
  - rscadd: The AME has gotten a bit of TLC, featuring new sounds, animations, a properly
      scaled UI that updates when interacted with, and the packaged reactor sections
      have gotten a new sprite and more importantly update the surrounding shield
      parts immediately after being deployed. The cores also emit a tiny bit of light
      when the AME is active. Finally the jars themselves now have in-hand icons,
      and feature a gauge on their side that displays how much fuel they have.
  - bugfix: Fixed blob meteors sometimes spawning adjacent duplicate blobs.
  - bugfix: Removed duplicate cables under Roidstation Engineering's SMES
  - tweak: Suiciding while holding one of the cyanide pills that Nuke Ops spawn with
      now instantly deals you all the damage that it would have done to you over time.
      That's 500 toxloss and 500 oxyloss, so basically an instant death without having
      to suicide AND succumb.
  - bugfix: Fixes examining people wearing accessories indicating "it has nothing"
      when there are in fact accessories
  - rscadd: Slimes processed inside a Slime Extractor now provide points to the crew
      score. The points provided remain constant regardless of the slime type, or
      whether it was on steroid.
  - tweak: Virology score for isolated antibodies has been substantially increased
      to account for the fact that each antibody can only be isolated once.
  - bugfix: Player-controlled Mice and Spiderlings are now prevented from spawning
      from vents on the Vox and Brig Outposts on RoidStation's main Station Z Level
      as those aren't connected to the rest of the main station's atmos.

      damage.
2021-07-25:
  Optimism333:
  - rscadd: The Grayy food company Zam now has its own vending machine. Recharge packs
      may be purchased at cargo for 25 credits per 2 packs.
  - rscadd: Some unique snacks and drinks for Grayys have been added. Some are even
      safe for non-Grayys to consume! Experiment at your own risk.

2021-07-26:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Black wristwatches such as those worn by nuclear operative can now be

      accessory to sell to the crew.
2021-07-28:
  DamianX:
  - rscadd: The suit modification station can now repaint plasmaman and vox suits.
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added a new machine, the Data Disk Duplicator. Insert first a data disk
      of any type in the source slot, then insert a blank or corrupted disk in the
      target slot, and after a few second, the target disk will pop out as a carbon
      copy of the source disk, including the various datas that were on it. You can
      print its circuit board at RnD but it's also simple enough that you can also
      use a solding iron on a blank circuit board to craft it. Warranty void if emagged.
  - rscadd: You can now print blank data disks at an autolathe under Misc Items. Diskette
      Boxes bought on the Merch computer already also come with a random amount of
      corrupted disks that finally have a purpose.
  - bugfix: Fixed players walking into splatters despite being in a vehicle.
  - bugfix: Mobs affected by timestop now have their movement capabilities updated
      right as the timestop ends, fixing issues related to status effects being acquired
      during timestop.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: Changed the Sacid recipe for proper stochiometry. In practice, you'll need
      double the oxygen to make any amount. This won't affect chem dispensers or any
      sacid-using recipe, only the ghetto-chem manufacture (or electrolysis) of Sacid.
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: Packed voting requirements have been restored to 0 minimum and 10 maximum.
  Optimism333:
  - rscadd: Zam Nitro Freeze contains less frost oil.

      of bounds in list checks.
2021-07-30:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed the rev Implant Pinpointer not tracking people in lockers, mechas,
      or any other sort of container.
2021-08-01:
  Hatterhat:
  - bugfix: Dorfstation's suit dispensers now actually dispense mining suits, instead
      of runtiming and then becoming unusable.
  - bugfix: Observers can now enjoy the "not being in a round" experience when on
      Dorfstation.
2021-08-02:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Vox Medical Doctors spawning with a duplicate uniform in their backpack
      instead of their job-specific labcoat. (loppu)
  - rscadd: When the Telecomms Traffic Console fails to find a network's servers you
      now get an explicit message telling you to either double check the network ID
      or the range from the servers. (west3436)
  - tweak: Growth Dishes printed out of an Isolation Centrifuge now spawn offset south
      a bit so the centrifuge's light overlays don't hinder clicking on it. (Killette2)
  - tweak: Node and Core Blob Meteors now have some penetration, meaning they will
      land deeper inside the station, allowing for more interesting fights. When passing
      through obstacles they leave strong blobs, which prevent airflow and the surprise
      venting of areas. (ApogeeSys)
  - tweak: Solar Panels have had their penetration dampening value drastically reduced
      to match their fragility.
  - rscadd: The Blob HUD has been refreshed using the brand new UI datum system that
      we first implemented a few days ago. Beside the back-end changes, the new UI
      has a few new features. The useless Spawn Normal Blob button has been replaced
      with a toggle to restrain automatic expansion through walls. The gauge features
      small symbols that accurately indicate how many points you need to perform certain
      actions, and the Spawn Blob Core icon now tells you explicitly that you need
      to place more Nodes to be able to place more Cores when their cost is higher
      than your point cap. Lastly it also features a new look, with more easily readable
      numbers and graduations.
  - rscadd: When trying to place a special Blob too close from another blob of the

      spawns you half-naked.

  - rscadd: Plates can now be stacked up, whether they are dirty or clean. You can
      clean a whole stack at once using soap. Be careful not to slip while carrying
      them.
  - rscadd: You can remove plates from a stack either with an Alt Click, or a Mouse
      Drag onto yourself. Alternatively, clicking a stack with a food item will add
      a plate to it in your hand directly.
  - rscadd: The Dinnerware now provides 5 stacks of 10 plates each, for a total of
      50 plates, up from 20.
  - rscadd: Plates now inflict 5 brute damage when thrown. They also have a 70 percent
      chance of shattering this way. Throwing a whole stack applies the chance to
      each individual plate but the damage isn't increased.
  - rscadd: Infected food will transmit its diseases to custom snacks it is added
      to, including plates. The dirty plate will keep those diseases as well, so there
      is now some purpose to cleaning them up before using them again.
  - imageadd: Plates have been removed from the sprites of most food items that had
      them.
  - imageadd: Plates now have in-hand icons. Placing food on plates will give them
      the in-hand icon of the food item used.
  - rscadd: Plates can be set up to look different depending on the food item, and
      have the item appear at an offset, which is useful for sprites that have visible
      pixels going below where the plate should be, such as for the dripping cheese
      on cheesy meat loafs.
  - bugfix: Fixed custom sandwiches made using sliced nova bread not using the correct
      sprite nor carrying the nova bread's reagents. (eneocho)
  - bugfix: Animated food items no longer stop animating when placed on a plate, such
      as for birthday cake slices.
  - rscadd: Eating food without a fork now has a chance of spawning some crumbs under
      you. The crumbs are colored depending on the food item eaten.
  - tweak: You now take 2 minutes to free yourself from a strange present, up from
      it being instant. (saulmyers)
  - bugfix: Fixed slime brains getting deleted when re-inserted into their puddles.
      (chaklet)

      On other intents you will simply empty its content and put it out.
  - rscadd: Cigarettes and Pipes now warn you about 5 seconds prior that they're about
      to go out, letting you extinguish them of your own accord. Blunts specifically
      will burn your lips for 1 burn damage if you let them go out while still on
      your lips or hands.
  - rscadd: You now get a message when trying to cut a pipe out of an ear of corn,
      telling you that you gotta eat it first.
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: The omnitool (from the cloud ix crate) now properly allows you to remote
      control any APC or air alarm as though you were a silicon, as long as you have
      the appropriate access. This means it will be "unlocked" even remotely when
      the omnitool is in your active hand.
  - bugfix: Fixed the bugs with using the omnitool at range.
  - tweak: Airshield projectors will not deploy an airshield when aimed at a storage
      container (like a backpack), table, or rack if adjacent to that object (includes
      wearing).
  - tweak: Ninjas now need to wear their suit to use hologram projectors.
  - tweak: Ninjas need to wait 2 deciseconds between throwing ninja stars, raised
      to 1 second if not wearing their suit. Additionally, they only get double throwing
      power when using the suit.

  - rscadd: Eggs now contain 1u of useless Calcium Carbonate.
  - rscadd: You can now crack eggs open onto a beaker or cauldron to transfer the
      yolk to them. Doing so will not add the calcium carbonate to the container,
      and instead produce some egg shells. (Bomber Harris)
  - rscadd: Thrown or Hatched eggs now leave some egg shells behind. Those can be
      grinded to get the calcium carbonate back, although it has no use currently.
  - imageadd: Added in-hand icons for most types and colours of eggs.
  - imageadd: Implemented the unused 4th splatter sprite that smashed eggs can have.
      (throwing eggs now produces both a splatter, and egg shells).
  - rscadd: You can now recover reagents from a microwave by holding an open reagent
      container while you eject its content.
  - tweak: Vampire Hypnotize now only fails on blinded people if their blindness is
      caused either by genetic or worn items. So you will no longer fail Hypnotized
      because you recently cast Glare. (mastercasual)
  - bugfix: Fixed some newscasters at Roidstation's brig not being Security newscasters.
      (theophrastus)
  - bugfix: Fixed a fire alarm at Box toxins lab being on a table instead of a wall.
      (Kurfurst)

  ShiftyRail:
  - experiment: A new lighting system is used in place of Goonlights.
  - rscadd: This system is darker, with objects casting shadows.
  - rscadd: 'It allows for many effects: flickering of light sources, objects glowing

  - rscadd: Some objects - supermatter shards, AME cores, glow in the dark.
  - rscadd: Firecamps emit more light.

      camera to send.

      Includes the ability to view all photos and send one in a PDA message. No printer
      included, though.

      instantly shutting off.
