      perfectly fine.
  - tweak: When locked in cages, AI aliens aren't able anymore to plant weed sacks,
      eggs, or beds. Queens can still spit acid to adjacent walls when angered but

      by a bolt of animation. Additionally, I've added a few variables that allow
      mappers to create mannequins that automatically awaken when they spawn, or when
      a mob walks next to them, or when you try to strip them, and that make nearby
      mannequins awaken as well. Destroying a Living Mannequin drop their items. If
      the mannequin was holding a highly damaging item when it woke up, it'll fight

      virus has a 100% chance of activating per tick, two viruses each have a 50%
      chance of activating per tick, three viruses each have 33% chance, etc. Get
