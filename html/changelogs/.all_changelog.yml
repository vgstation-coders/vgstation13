  - tweak: Trying to clone a husk now provides a more informative error message, rather
      than the generic 'mental interface failure'. This message also tells you if
      the dead guy can still rejoin their corpse, so you can try to clone a husk before
      attempting a head transplant and know you're not wasting your time on someone
      that already logged out.
  - spellcheck: Updated the in-game 'Cloning techniques of the 26th Century' book
      that spawns in Genetics so that it's not outdated by several years.
  - rscadd: Added pill color selection directly into the main menu of ChemMasters,
      to make it more convenient to switch pill colors.
  - rscadd: ChemMasters will now remember the last amount of pills and bottles created,
      making that the default input.
  - experiment: Some optimization that should hopefully fix ChemMasters taking a little
      while to open their window when used for the first time in the round.

  - bugfix: Also fixed border firelocks that were in the same tile as an airlock becoming
      locked when they shouldn't, due to checking the air 'inside' the firelock, rather
      than the air on the other side.

      Centcom Announcement:'

      at 0.1u, drinks will require 0.2u rather than 0.1u minimum.
  - bugfix: Fixed cameras making people naked, hated every single second of trying
      to fix it. If you notice in-hand icons fucking up for any reason please don't

      or welded doors.

  - rscadd: Adds a new gamemode, Revolutionary Squad, which is a variant on revolution
      with an emphasis on a small, organized group of underequipped revolutionaries
      trying to kill the heads instead of a large group of gretiders.
  - tweak: Revsquad members only sometimes spawn with a flash capable of converting
      crew members, and it always has limited uses. They cannot use a standard flash

      targettable, shooting it wherever you click.

      direction.

      a sheet of paper (must have a blank piece of paper lying on the ground).

      a human, a fat human, a monkey, or a vox.

      a mob walks next to them, or when you try to strip them, and that make nearby
      mannequins awaken as well. Destroying a Living Mannequin drop their items. If

  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Genetics colored SE tabs will now auto-backup if there is a diskette inserted
      in the console. This is so that your tab colors aren't irreversibly lost if
      the console gets damaged or deconstructed.
  - tweak: Buckets can now hold 150 units, up from 70. However, they won't fit in
      machinery, such as chemdispensers.
  - bugfix: Added a system to allow for more specific sharp item requirements, to
      prevent weird stuff like skinning animals with a syringe or slicing a cake with
      a pickaxe. NOTE that this means miners cannot butcher asteroid mobs using their
      drills anymore!
  - tweak: Mining vending machines now stock cheap boot knife holsters, to compensate
      for drills not being able to butcher asteroid mobs anymore.

      missing.

      sprite wherever you click on it.

      one z-level.
