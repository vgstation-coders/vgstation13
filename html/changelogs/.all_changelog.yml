  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Players sacrificed with an empty soul blade are now properly converted.
  - rscadd: Clicking on an empty soda can with HARM intent on will crush the can in
      your hand, making a satisfying sound. Crushed cans are considered a trash item
      so they will persist between rounds. They can no longer be cut with wirecutters
      or used to hold reagents, however they can still be ground into aluminum using
      a mortar, or fed to an auto-lathe for a bit of iron.
  - rscadd: Crushed cans deal 2 brute damage instead of one when thrown, and can be
      thrown slightly further and faster that regular cans.

  - tweak: Cult's weight has been lowered, making it less likely to roll at roundstart.
2019-07-08:
  DamianX:
  - tweak: Freedom implants will always have 5 uses, whereas previously they could
      have a random amount between 1 and 5.
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Pale beings in crit now have an overlay applied to them, indicating to
      everyone that they're in crit. As a reminder, even though they don't fall unconscious,
      they still take periodic oxygen damage.
  - tweak: Pale beings in crit now take 1 brute damage per second. Unlike oxygen damage,
      they cannot just heal it through fervor by themselves.
  - tweak: Pale beings now die at -50 hp instead of -100 hp. This means that a fully
      charged egun can take an armored pale body down if every shot connects, without
      having to rely on crit damage over time to finish the job.
  DrSnips:
  - rscadd: Detectives now have a belt that can carry most of the gear from their
      locker and other job related items such as fingerprint cards. Also added a spray
      bottle of luminol, switchblade, and sec tape to their gear box.

  - rscadd: Scientists spawn with random ties.
  - tweak: Nanotrasen will notify via the intercept if the station is in the most
      dangerous area possible.
  - tweak: Your Dreamseeker window will now flash orange if you are given an admin
      PM or if a gamemode is looking for candidates.
2019-07-09:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: Viro has been completely rewritten! The implications are huge so I'll
      try to organize the changelog with information relevant to most players at the
      top.
  - rscadd: All medbays now feature a bookcase full of medical manuals, including
      the brand new Virology guide, and an Encyclopedia of all disease symptoms. This
      Encyclopedia automatically updates itself as new symptoms are added in the code.
  - rscadd: For the time being Virologists will spawn holding the new Virology guide
      manual, this manual may also be found in Virology itself. If you play Virologist,
      give it a read. If you just want to know how to cure diseases in the heat of
      the moment, the first chapter is a step by step crash course for you.
  - rscadd: You may now use an Health Analyser on any living being to check whether
      they are carrying some pathogen.
  - rscadd: New players have a 10% chance of spawning with a weak and mostly harmless
      disease. Those can be easily cured with 5u spaceacillin.
  - rscadd: Mice that spawn in maint have a 20% chance of carrying a disease. Said
      disease is never airborne, but is notably more dangerous than those that humans
      can spawn with.
  - rscadd: Minor and Major viral outbreaks have been reworked. Both will instantly
      infect 10% of the station's crew with the same pathogen, so if an individual
      is cure, it'll be relatively easy to cure the rest. Major outbreaks however
      are likely to carry dangerous pathogen.
  - rscadd: Poisoned Syndi meat pizza has been "fixed". It previously spawned filled
      with infected AB+ blood, which means that only crewmembers of AB+ blood type
      could actually get infected.
  - rscadd: When getting attacked by blob or blob spores, you may get infected with
      a new type of pathogen that's single stage and doesn't do anything on its own.
      If you die while infected, you'll spawn some blob tiles around you. The longer
      you've been infected, the more tiles you'll spawn, even spawning a node after
      5 minutes. Blob spores that die also leave a pathogenic cloud behind them, so
      be sure to wear a hardsuit or some sterile equipment when fighting the blob
      up close, and get checked at medbay after the threat has been dealt with. This
      symptom may be exploited to created blob walls of specific shape.
  - rscadd: Loose Catbeasts that arrive on the station are carriers of not one but
      TWO dangerous diseases! Be careful when hunting them down. As the catbeast yourself,
      you may try to acquire and drink some milk and some water to cause your diseases
      to progress faster.
  - rscadd: Added a new midround ruleset that may proc if there are at least two Medical
      Doctors, or CMO, or Virologist. Plague Mice Invasion. A group of 1 to 5 mice
      infected with a dangerous Bacteria appear on the station and try to spread their
      disease to as many mobs as possible while the crew tries to stomp them and cure
      their disease. Enable Minor Roles to be allowed for candidacy.
  - rscadd: Urn and Bowls found in Xenoarchaeology now have a chance of containing
      some blood infected with a disease. Such diseases tend to have generally helpful
      symptoms.
  - rscadd: Large Xenoarchaeolgy artifacts have a new potential effect that causes
      them to release pathogenic clouds carrying a disease of random dangerosity.
  - rscadd: Given admins some tools to easily create highly customized diseases, essentially
      letting them control every aspect of the disease and its effects. They may even
      give the disease up to 100 stages but then setting up each stage might becomes
      a chore. Said disease may be inoculated inside a mob, or spawned inside a growth
      dish.
  - rscadd: Admins also now have a panel that displays every disease currently in
      the world and where they came from, who's infected by it, what items are infected
      by it, which growth dish contains them, and whether they're in the database
      or not (which admins can actually toggle).
  - rscadd: Growth dishes now have their appearance depend on the disease in them.
      with a random color and a random pattern of a random color. Major mutations
      may cause a variation in color.
  - rscadd: The Pathogen database now lists mutated pathogen as children of the original
      pathogen, making archiving sensibly easier. Pathogen may also now be given a
      nickname instead of a name. Said nickname will appear when the disease is analyzed
      in a mob or on the Medical HUD. You may also change the disease's dangerosity
      from Undetermined to Safe or Dangerous, which will change the appearance of
      the Status icon that appears on the Medical HUD.
  - rscadd: If wearing a Medical PDA with its health scanner activated, the PDA will
      tell its owner if they suddenly got infected with a disease.
  - rscadd: Wizarditis has been ported to virus2 at long last, and has been reworked
      to be more !!fun!!. After being infected for a while, you will start shouting
      random spells, but unlike the old version, each spell you randomly shout will
      actually be cast! Thankfully the proc chance is reasonably low.
  - rscadd: All symptoms now have a Danger value that ranges like so. 0 for helpful.
      1 for flavor text. 2 for annoying. 3 for hindrance. 4 for harmful. 5 for deadly.
  - rscadd: Diseases may incubate inside irradiated mobs, and should they also have
      mutagen in their system, they may induce an effect mutation. However effects
      mutating this way will only switch to an effect of similar Danger.
  - rscadd: Chemistry secure lockers now contain a box of vials, allowing them to
      preserve blood samples from infected patients and transmit them to Virology.
  - rscadd: All bio suit lockers now also contain a pair of Science Goggles. These
      can now be turned on to let their wearer easily find airborne pathogenic clouds,
      items and mobs infected with contact pathogen, and floor splatters that contain
      pathogen as well.
  - rscadd: Tech Storages on all maps have a new rack containing spare circuitboards
      for all virology machines.
  - rscadd: Toxin Firstaid Kits have had one of their Anti-Toxin syringes replaced
      with a Spaceacillin syringe.
  - rscadd: ERTs now have a box of vials and two pill boxes of nanofloxacin at their
      HQ, as well as a centrifuge on their shuttle, and two more science goggles in
      their back room, allowing them to efficiently deal with epidemics.
  - rscadd: Rewritten the ways diseases can transmit both by contact and through the
      air. A disease may have one or several spread vectors, allowing it to spread
      both by contact or through the air. This also opens the door for new exotic
      spread vectors down the line.
  - rscadd: Diseases with the contact spread vector may also temporarily contaminate
      items. Higher infectability means it lingers on the item for a longer time.
      Infected items can simply be washed at a sink, washing machine, or sprayed with
      Space Cleaner to remove the pathogen.
  - rscadd: All items (and most importantly, clothing) have a sterility variable that
      indicates their chance to not get infected (or protect their wearer from infection).
  - rscadd: The antibody scanner has been reworked and is now called the immunity
      scanner. It can be used on any item to get their sterility value, or any living
      mob to get an analysis of their immune system.
  - rscadd: When touching or hitting someone, the checks for infection are done depending
      on which body part enters in contact. (for example, when shaking hands, both
      hands are checked, but when patting a head, your hands are checked along with
      the head being patted. Only one side has to succeed in a sterility check to
      prevent infection).
  - rscadd: Similar checks are performed when a mob bumps into another mob. When bumping
      into someone, you hands are checked against the other's torso. However if bumping
      into a tiny mob, such as a mouse, your feet are the ones checked.
  - rscadd: Due to how items can get infected if they aren't sterile, keep that in
      mind when hitting someone or performing surgery. Science goggles can easily
      reveal infected items.
  - rscadd: Pathogen that can only spread through blood may still spread through contact
      if both parts checked are bleeding.
  - rscadd: Also, blood that's been infected with pathogen that spreads through contact
      may also infect individuals by being splashed upon them.
  - rscadd: Sterilizine can now be sprayed over items to increase their sterility
      permanently by 30 points.
  - rscadd: Airborne pathogen no longer spread instantly to adjacent mobs. Instead
      whenever a mob infected with an airborne pathogen breathes with its mouth unobstructed
      and unfiltered, they release a pathogenic cloud that contains all their airborne
      diseases, and that moves accross the room, further the higher the pathogen's
      infectability variable is. Another mob may then get infected if they are close
      to such a cloud when they breath themselves. Mobs breath every 8 seconds on
      average, and clouds linger for about 10 seconds. Pathogenic clouds do NOT spread
      through vents, for now at least.
  - rscadd: Monkeys now have Status and Health bars displayed on the Medical HUD.
      Mice have their Status icon displayed as well.
  - rscadd: The monkey-sized doctor clothing fully protects its wearer from contracting
      or spreading diseases.
  - rscadd: All mice may get infected just as easily as human and monkey, and most
      symptoms will work on them as well.
  - rscadd: You may now use an empty syringe on a mice to draw 5u of blood, inflicting
      them 5 oxy damage.
  - rscadd: Added small critter cages. Can be crafted with a bit of Plasteel, and
      placed on a table or on the floor. You can pick up mice by drag n dropping them
      on yourself with Grab intent, and then place them inside those cages. You can
      then pick up the cage by drag n dropping it onto yourself.
  - rscadd: Mice in cages may not contract or spread diseases, unless they get pet
      through the cage.
  - rscadd: You may add some reagents to the cage, which will cause the mice in them
      to start gulping them up. You may also add some food on top of the cage to feed
      the mice in it.
  - rscadd: Mice now have a chewing animation which they play whenever they eat or
      they chew cables.
  - rscadd: Player-controlled mice may click on mobs to nibble their toes, which may
      cause contact diseases to spread if contact can be made. If the mob is lying
      down, they may also try to nibble fingers or ear lobes.
  - rscadd: Virology now features its own pet mice, of the Balb/c strain. Its name
      is randomized, but it'll keep company to people in Virology. Don't forget to
      feed them!
  - rscadd: Oh right and Virology itself works a lot differently, like, just read
      the in-game Crash Course in Virology manual, Virologists spawn with it and it
      can be found in both Medbay's bookcase and Virology itself. All machines have
      been reworked and mutating and curing diseases is also a bit different so just
      go read that. It'd really be too long for a changelog.
  - rscadd: If you play Medbay YOU SHOULD READ THAT. Or at least the first chapter.
  - rscadd: Antigen now have rarity. Weak diseases tend to have more easily aquired
      antigen, while more dangerous diseases have antigen that are harder to obtain
      before an outbreak.
  - rscadd: Medbots now detect diseases that are in the database in individuals, and
      try to inject them with spaceacillin. They may no longer detect old diseases
      but they didn't do much to help with those anyway.
  - rscadd: The green old sadface status icon is still used to indicate individual
      infected with old diseases, such as appendicitis.
  - rscadd: Added a Laboratory Mice supply pack to cargo, containing some small cages
      and also mousecubes. Yeah those are a thing now.
  - rscadd: All mice now lose half less nutrition by moving and standing, and gain
      twice more by eating.
  Kharkov72:
  - rscadd: Adds the fat religion.
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: Soul Ramblers can now show up in any population, but prefer to ramble in
      lowpop shifts.
  - rscdel: The Proto-Kinetic Accelerator is no longer purchased at the mining vendor
      ($300)
  - rscadd: A PKA warp voucher can be bought at the mining vendor ($25). This turns
      into a PKA when brought into the mine.
  - tweak: Sending plasma back to centcomm on the supply shuttle now pays out 5x as
      much, for a total of 10x (it originally paid 2x value).
  MadmanMartian:
  - rscadd: Cyborg chargers now accept anyone that has a cell to them, not just silicons.
  - tweak: The cyborg charger now draws energy from the grid properly.
  SonixApache:
  - bugfix: Ninjas can now teleport again
  - tweak: Handgun holsters can now hold bananas.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where calculated armor could reach values below 0, making
      damage sources deal even more damage than intended, such as a ninja sword that
      dealt approx. 90 damage per hit on an unarmored target.
  - soundadd: Geiger counter now plays a sound when it detects radiation.
2019-07-10:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: The round end scoreboard will now add and remove points from the crew
      score based on how many beneficial or harmful diseases are loose in living mobs.
  - tweak: Plague Mice Invasion event only considers mobs as "still infected" on the
      round end scoreboard if they're still alive.
  - bugfix: maybe fixed a bug that caused medical HUDs to display the ill status even
      though the disease hasn't been added to the database.
  - rscadd: humans turning into zombies upon death keep their diseases, which may
      then transmit to their meat. (zombies themselves can't spread their diseases
      for now, more to that later)
  - rscadd: mice in small cages get a similar buff to antipathogenic efficiency that
      other mobs get when they rest in a bed.
  - rscadd: Admin Diseases Panel now indicate the disease's nickname if there's one
  - rscadd: Admin Diseases Panel is now accessible from the Admin tab instead of Debug.
  PaulRitter:
  - tweak: reworked the instrument ui a bit more
2019-07-11:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed mobs like cockroach being invisible in cages because they appear
      bellow them. Mobs placed in cages have their plane changed to the default mob
      plane.
  - bugfix: Mice can no longer use the Hide verb when in a cage.
  - rscadd: Added some open growth dishes for mappers, both empty and containing a
      random disease
  - rscadd: The round end scoreboard now indicates which disease was spread the most,
      as well as its symptoms.
  - rscadd: Ghosts can now use the pathogen HUD
  - rscadd: Cats no longer chase mice while dead or uncounscious. Let them rest in
      peace.
  - rscadd: Mucus or Sputum caused by Coldingtons and Respiratory Putrefaction now
      only spawn if the mob is on top of a turf (so mice in vents won't spawn any).
      That should curb the amount of mucus spawning all around the station.
  - rscadd: Nanomed plus now has 8 vials to dispense. With the 6 in virology and the
      6 in Chemistry that's 20 vials in medbay.
  - bugfix: Fixed blank vaccines sometimes mysteriously already containing antigen
      brewed in other vaccines someplace else.
  - bugfix: Fixed Observer Pathogen HUD not properly updating when disease is getting
      removed from items and mobs.
  - bugfix: Fixed Plague Mice Invasion ruleset only spawning one mouse instead of
      up to five.
  Kharkov72:
  - rscadd: Darkholme no longer goes full retard.
  - rscadd: Corn Oil exists again
  - rscadd: The Janitor Cargo Crate has mousetraps now.
2019-07-12:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Tech Storage on all maps having two Disease Analyser boards instead
      of one, and missing a Disease Splicer board.
  GlassEclipse:
  - rscadd: Less than legitimate forces in your sector have learned how to build black
      market uplinks. They don't offer any goods for sale yet.
  Kharkov72:
  - rscadd: Fixed a typo!
2019-07-13:
  DamianX:
  - bugfix: Fixed speech disabilities not working if other genes were activated or
      the dude was a plasmaman.
  GlassEclipse:
  - rscadd: Added friendly cultist cyborg boards to the trader vendor. They can only
      be used on service borgs.
  Kharkov72:
  - rscadd: Under the hood roid tweaks, but the teleporter looks a bit different...
2019-07-14:
  Kharkov72:
  - bugfix: Various Deff Fixes
  - bugfix: Various Box Fixes
  bathosbathtime:
  - rscdel: reverted "friendly Cultist Cyborgs"
2019-07-25:
  Arthurdentist:
  - rscadd: Added a new premium jacket to the nazi-vend
  DamianX:
  - tweak: Cultists will have to sacrifice an implanted crew member. Only if there
      is no implanted personnel on the station they will be able to sacrifice a non-implanted
      crew member.
  - rscadd: Added an option to show admin messages in both the special tab and chat.
  - tweak: Loose catbeasts only have mildly annoying diseases when they arrive. As
      they survive longer and defile more areas they get up to two more (increasingly
      deadly) diseases.
  - rscadd: Re-added wizard's apprenticeship contracts to the spellbook.
  - tweak: Added a short cooldown to fedora tipping.
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Removed the need for the +Debug flag to fully use the Diseases Panel
  - tweak: Lowered the volume of the science goggles's pathogen scanner being toggled
  - tweak: Melisso-Emeto Syndrome's chance of making you cough up bees no longer depends
      of how much honey you have in you. As it stood, the formula combined with the
      speed at which honey metabolizes made it so you never cough up any bees at all.
  - bugfix: Fixed meat butchered from infected mobs magically curing itself after
      a few minutes
  - bugfix: Fixed bees never coming out of their apiary on some maps.
  - bugfix: 'Dynamic Mode: fixed High Population Override counting non-ready players
      toward its trigger.'
  - bugfix: 'Dynamic Mode: fixed basically no ruleset other than traitor or vampire
      firing at roundstart for the past two weeks.'
  - rscadd: Medical Borg grippers can now pick up vials from vial storage boxes, you
      can open the container by drag and dropping it onto yourself while adjacent.
  - rscadd: Medical Borgs now have an immunity scanner among their modules.
  - bugfix: You may no longer use immunity scanners on silicons, DUH.
  - tweak: Toxin Sublimation, the disease symptom that causes you to emit plasma,
      has had its danger rating upped from 4 to 5, due to its high station-ruining
      potential. This makes it much less likely to appear in loose catbeasts, and
      won't let it appear at all in maintenance mice.
  - bugfix: Fixed both Caloric Expenditure syndromes basically not working at all.
  - bugfix: Fixed Arachnogenesis Effect being rated as Danger 3 instead of 4. This
      change means it can never appear in maintenance mice again.
  - tweak: Made Glasgow Syndrome actually work I guess.
  - bugfix: Fixes dead infected mice being able to still breathe pathogenic clouds,
      and have their pathogen activate.
  - tweak: Reduced the chance of being sick upon spawn from 10% to 5%
  - tweak: Diseases that spawn in new players now have at most 20% infectability,
      highly reducing their contamination potential.
  - bugfix: Fixed Delightful Syndrome being rated as Danger 3 instead of 0.
  - imageadd: Added in-hand sprites for many types of boxes, cigarette packets, and
      vial storage boxes.
  - imageadd: Added missing in-hand sprites for lab mice, plague mice, and mouse ops.
  - rscadd: Rewrote the vial storage box icon code, and that of its secure version,
      which now features the reagents contained in the vials.
  - bugfix: Fixed cult runes not containing pathogen when drawn with pathogen-infected
      blood.
  - tweak: Janitor's galoshes are now fully sterile.
  - tweak: You can no longer get infected from passing over a mice while aboard a
      vehicle.
  - tweak: Loose Catbeasts are now half as likely to carry a deadly disease (from
      10% to 5%). Depending on feedback the chance may be fully removed later.
  - tweak: Growth dishes from Virology or Cargo can now only spawn with the blood
      (OABRh) and common (QUV) antibodies.
  - tweak: When mutating a disease's antigen by incubating it with radium, the new
      antigen will be picked among a weighted list that no longer includes the X,
      Y and Z antigen.
  - bugfix: ACTUALLY Fixed dynamic mode roundstart. I swear.
  - bugfix: Fixed Laboratory Mice not being numbered.
  - bugfix: Fixed spiky skin syndrome causing infected people to get hurt when checking
      themselves for injuries.
  GlassEclipse:
  - rscadd: Added the black market, for real this time. Barebones for now. Items will
      be added.
  - rscadd: 'To use the black market, obtain an uplink and put money in it. An official
      one spawns on the bridge, but you can also make a worse ghetto one: (Weld table
      parts -> Ghetto Ansible) -> (Station bounced radio -> Screwdriver -> Ghetto

      over the traitor uplink and discounted for Botanists, Engis and the CE.

  - bugfix: Fixed persistent bee corpses being invisible.
  - bugfix: Ghosts can now read the labels on analyzed growth dishes.
  - tweak: Roundstart diseases are now flavor text only 80% of the time, with 10%
      chance of having a beneficial symptom, and 10% (down from 50%) chance of having
      a lesser annoying symptom (such as Loudness syndrome)
  - tweak: Automated Sleeping Syndrome danger rating increased from annoying to hindrance,
      so it can no longer be a roundstart symptom.
  - tweak: Catbeasts no longer suffer from their own disease's symptoms.
  - tweak: Infected blood found in Urns or Bowls in Xenoarch now always contains beneficial
      symptoms.
  - tweak: Pathogenic Clouds-emitting large artifacts now always contain deadly symptoms
      (accounting for the fact that those are pretty damn rare)
  - tweak: Reduced the chance for infected maint mice to have the Contact spread vector
      from 60% to 40%. Mice without this vector can not spread their disease, but
      may still provide a virologist with some rare antigen and an extra sample.
  - tweak: The isolation centrifuge now sends you a warning if you try to synthesize
      a vaccine with a duration longer than a minute or two.

  Kharkov72:

  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Removed the 10% chance for blob spores to bypass protections and infect
      you through sterile clothing, such as spacesuits or biosuits.

      to 6.
  - bugfix: Fixed Blob Spores-created blob tiles that always featured the default
      blob looks, even when the infection came from a different type of blob.

  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that prevented crawling in the emergency shuttle brig.
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: The Advanced Energy Gun gets a brand new look courtesy of otatoh. The
      old sprite still exists and an "experimental" version using it can be spawned
      by admins.
  - bugfix: Fixed the old AEG's in-hand sprite never properly updating as its charge
      diminishes.
  - tweak: Changed the way AEGs react to EMPs, they now have 10 points of "core stability".
      When getting EMP'd, they lose 4 points if the EMP is strong, and 2 if it's weak.
      This affects their recharge rate (which is 10 times the core stability, so 100
      charge by default every 4 seconds.), and creates a radiation burst once it reaches
      zero. The radiation now always reaches up to 4 tiles away, but the amount received
      decreases with the distance (300 rad on the same tile and adjacent, then divided
      by the distance from the gun). Previously a critical AEG would keep producing
      deadly radiation burst every few seconds. If the AEG lost some stability but
      it still is over zero, it has a percentage chance equal to its current core
      stability to recover some of it every second. AEGs no longer have a chance to
      produce radiation bursts as long as they have some stability left, otherwise
      the gun becomes unusable.

      in culture bottles in high risk spawners.'
