  DeityLink:
  - experiment: Centcomm Orders have been reworked and greatly expanded upon!
  - rscadd: Added a ton of new Centcomm Orders that can be shipped at Cargo. Three
      random orders are created at round start, more are created every 20 to 40 minutes
      depending on the population on the crew manifest. Departments with already active
      orders/no population are way less likely to receive new orders.
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has also just remembered that they really like plasma and that
      was the reason why the Space Stations were first built in that system. Shipping
      Plasma sheets in crates will add money directly to the Station funds. The order
      for plasma sheets is always available.
  - rscadd: Cargo receives a bonus payment of 10% of the fulfilled order's value every
      time an order for an other department gets fulfilled.
  - rscadd: Requested items can also be brought to the Emergency Shuttle instead of
      Cargo. They will be processed (but not deleted) when the shuttle reaches Centcom
      just as if they had been shipped through the Supply Shuttle (Requirements such
      as being in a crate or not still apply). Shipping items this way won't grant
      Cargo a bonus.
  - rscadd: Departments that may receive orders will appear on the round end scoreboard
      in a leaderboard. All that matters to rank up is the money on the department's
      account at round end. Any way to increase that number (or reduce the number
      of other departments) are fair game. Try to have your department reach rank
      1!
  - rscadd: When a Centcomm Order is created, the Request Consoles of the concerned
      departments will receive a message (wow those finally have a purpose?)
2020-09-19:
  toomykins:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen HR will automate any requests sent with the magnetic stamp
      again, and you can still fax any other paperwork to them too!
2020-09-20:
  gurfan:
  - tweak: Shunted AIs can use the VOX announcement system to taunt the crew, even
      after their original core was destroyed.
2020-09-22:
  Buchse:
  - rscadd: Vox tail-regen tech surges forwards.
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: Malfunctioning AIs will now get a screen alarm while hacking an APC.
  - bugfix: Fixed Malfunctioning AIs being stuck hacking forever if the target APC
      got destroyed.
  - tweak: The hack time for Malfunctioning AIs has been reverted to a flat 60 seconds.
  - rscadd: AI's can now swap between a cyborg shell and their main core!
  - rscadd: AI's can now create cyborg shells from completed cyborg skeletons that
      are visible to the AI. The AI can only have one shell at a time; the previous
      one must be destroyed before a new one can be made. The AI can gib their shell
      at any time using an action button. (Even while the shell is dead!)
  - rscadd: AI-Cyborg Shells have a unique title on the radio and a white glow to
      their eyes, unlike normal cyborgs. When emagged, they will gib instead of receiving
      a syndicate lawset.
  - rscadd: Completed cyborg exoskeletons can be touched with an empty hand to prevent/allow
      the AI to turn it into a shell.
  - rscadd: Cyborg exoskeletons can now be smashed apart with anything as strong as
      a toolbox. Doing so will destroy the exoskeleton but drop any attached parts
      (arms, legs, torso, head) on the ground. It will also make a good mess for the
      janitor to clean up.
  - tweak: Dead silicons will improve the crew score instead of penalizing it when
      there's a Malfunctioning AI.
2020-09-23:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Cargo not getting monetary contribution for "per unit" orders, such
      as plasma shipments to Centcom.
  - tweak: Fixed Chaplain not having a set wage amount. It has been fixed to 35.
  - tweak: Raised Virologist wage from 45 to 55, same as geneticist and paramedic,
      since they interact a lot more with the crew since the rework.
  - tweak: Raised Department wages from 50 to 100.
  - tweak: Reworked the way wages are processed. Salaries are now drawn directly from
      the station funds, with Nanotrasen then recharging it for the next payroll based
      on the default salaries (with an additional recharge before the payroll to take
      latejoiners into account), with an overhead of 10%. Effectively, that means
      all salaries are being increased by 10%. This also means that all salaries across
      the station will tank should the AI spend all the station funds on monkey cube
      crates, or get raised should miners ship lots of Plasma to Centcom.
  - tweak: salary payout announcements now take much less space in the chat window.
2020-09-27:

  - bugfix: Explosions will no longer reflect beams at their shooters and instantly
      kill them.

  - rscadd: You scream differently if you wear an armor vest now.

      calcium.'
  SonixApache:
  - tweak: Foam extinguishers are now once again effective at cooling reasonably sized
      rooms. They can't supercool things, and Very Large rooms will need actual solutions.
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: Added civil protection uniforms, helmets, and armors to the Secvend's
      contraband section.
  - bugfix: Roburgers, MoMMI Spaghetti, ect. should all transform people again.
  - rscadd: Reworked transformation viruses to use the modern virus system. They now
      have their own unique symptoms as well.
  - rscadd: Space Retrovirus and Toxic Compensation are available again as stage 4
      and stage 3 symptoms, respectively.
  - tweak: Using a screwdriver on a closed switchtool will dump out every module from
      it. Clicking on a pile of tools with a closed switchtool will attempt to load
      every tool in that pile into the switchtool.
2020-10-11:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: 'Cult 2020: Seer runes and talismans now let cultists figure out the propension
      of nearby crew members to accept or refuse conversion, allowing cultists to
      target people who actually want to be cultists and reducing frustration for
      everyone involved. Implanted crew members appear as unconvertable (as they will
      be once Conversions are reworked next).'
  - tweak: 'Cult 2020: Seer talisman duration increased from 8 seconds to 1 minute.'
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: Added the "Core Defenses Upgrade" Malf Module, which gives the AI a suite
      of upgrades to their turrets and physical core.
  - rscdel: Removed the "Core Upgrade" and "Turret Upgrade" Malf Modules (Now part
      of Core Defense)
  - imageadd: Updated the AI upload sprite to show inserted AIs.
  - rscadd: Malfunctioning AIs can now send custom falsified announcements.
  - rscadd: Malfunctioning AIs that fake pre-existing announcements will cause the
      announcement's respective music to play or stop, so long as the AI hasn't started
      their takeover yet.
  - tweak: Silicons can middle-shift click on airlocks to enable/disable door safeties.
  - rscadd: The Blackout Malf Module will now disable RCDs and scramble radios on
      the station in addition to breaking lights.
  - rscdel: Removed the RCD Disable Malf Module (Now part of Blackout)
2020-10-12:
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: You can now ward against halloween horrors using piles of salt.
2020-10-13:
  DamianX:
  - bugfix: 'Bagelstation: Added lights to R&D and Librarian''s office.'
  - bugfix: DNA injectors and DNA modifiers will now transfer unique enzymes if they
      are in the DNA buffer, as intended. This means stealing someone's identity will
      let one through DNA locks such as those used by mechs.
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed the Seer talisman's effects never going away.
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to use several of a Seer talisman's charges at once,
      resulting in visual effects stacking up. You now have to wait for the effect
      to time out before being able to use another charge.
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: A haunted trick or treat bucket, please boo with caution
  Zth--:
  - tweak: Areas without APCs can no longer have overlays
2020-10-14:
  DamianX:
  - tweak: Battering rams can now be applied to firelocks.
  - tweak: Things being battering-rammed now visually shake. The sound effect of the
      ram plays throughout the whole thing rather than only at the beginning.
  SonixApache:
  - tweak: the syndicate harm baton no longer has a name that is different from a
      normal stun baton.

  - imageadd: Added new in-hand sprites for some of the more popular bar drinks
  RealestEstate:

      sec metagame

      underneath it.'

  - bugfix: 'Bagelstation: Added a bunch of lights to medbay.'

      office.'

      camera console. Added missing sinks to chemistry, surgery, virology. Added airlocks
      and plastic flaps to the maintenance tunnels from engineering to science. Escape
      pods are now airtight. Research shuttlke dock APC is now wired.'
2020-10-26:
  DamianX:
  - tweak: 'Bagelstation: After receiving several complaints regarding time wasted
      traversing the hallways, we''ve decided to install a shuttle to transport crew
      members from the aft starboard hallway to the dormitories.'
  - rscadd: 'Metaclub: added 3 silver coins to QM office'
  - rscadd: Added a morgue holosign to all morgue airlocks. They light up if there's
      one or more revivable bodies in the morgue trays.
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: The Monster Mash drink can now be made at the bar, how terrifying!
  PlausibleDeniability:
  - imageadd: Created insectoid variants for the majority of leftover masks
  - tweak: Insectoids have gained the ability to contort their heads to fit in balaclavas
      and other masks!
2020-11-04:
  Allspice:
  - bugfix: Emagging the message monitor console no longer makes it invisible.
  DamianX:
  - tweak: Nuke ops might be more likely to spawn at round start.
  - bugfix: Typing indicators (say bubbles) should no longer show up in the right-click
      menu or prevent people from riding MULEbots. Yeah.
  - tweak: Changed maximum name length from 26 to 52.
  DeityLink:
  - imageadd: After SEVEN FUCKING YEARS, cable cuffs finally appear like cable cuffs
      instead of metallic handcuffs on cuffed mobs.
  - imageadd: '...and as I just learned that belts, bedsheets, gauze, and a few more
      can be used as ghetto cuffs as well, I just had to make sprites for all of those
      as well.'
  - bugfix: Also fixed spaghetti cuffs and gauze cuffs.
  - rscadd: Soulstoning someone with a soul gem instead of a soul stone shard will
      spawn a coffer containing their belongings, their skull, and a glass of their
      blood like failed conversions currently do (but not for long, conversion overhaul
      coming very soon)
  - rscadd: Committing suicide while holding a soul stone, soul gem, or soul blade
      that don't already contain a shade will let you capture yourself. Most useful
      when done with a soul blade obviously. Using a soul blade this way will set
      its blood count to 50 if it was any lower.
  - tweak: Pale Bodies now drop all their items upon death instead of them being destroyed
      when they dust.
  - tweak: Shades have had their HP raised back to their original value, from 40 to
      50 (It was lowered in 2018 on the day after Cult 3.0 released because apparently
      people thought they were too strong somehow?)
  - tweak: Shades and Constructs can now understand galactic common, and speak it
      with :1. This includes chaos blades. Non-cult constructs on the other hand can
      speak in cult chants if they so desire using :5.
  - tweak: Edited the name and description of a few Artificer spells for consistency
      and clarity.
  - bugfix: Fixed various cult and antag items being freely scannable by mechanics.
  - bugfix: Fixed a few instances where soul stones or blade could capture a sacrifice
      target (not counting using an empty soul blade for the sacrifice)
  - bugfix: Potentially fixed remaining instances of shades in soul blades not properly
      getting their UI
  PrimeDSS13:
  - bugfix: You now only notice the weight difference of the SMG briefcase if holding
      it.
  Zth--:
  - bugfix: Fixes visor helmet runtime possibly causing head damage invulnerability
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where you could roll a malfunctioning AI on Castle, a map
      that did not have any AIs, promptly returning you back to the lobby when the
      game realized there was nowhere to spawn the malf AI on
2020-11-05:
  PlausibleDeniability:
  - rscadd: 'Created Insectoid sprites for the following suits: AutoDrobe, PietyVend,
      Winter Coats, Wizard Robes, common rigsuits'
  - bugfix: There were a few insectoid sprites already in the DMI that didn't have
      its species_fit set, such as coatwarden, now working
2020-11-07:
  DamianX:
  - tweak: 'Metaclub: Added a bunch of portable scrubbers to maintenance tunnels.'
  IThe-TI:
  - rscadd: Added the beer box, craftable with one sheet of cardboard
  PlausibleDeniability:
  - rscadd: 'Created Insectoid sprites for the following hats: AutoDrobe, PietyVend,
      Wizard hats and other common hats'
  - bugfix: There were a few insectoid sprites already in the DMI that didn't have
      its species_fit set, now working
2020-11-09:
  PrimeDSS13:
  - tweak: autoborgers have a cooldown again
2020-11-11:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: Until now, the game's checks for dexterity were split between two
      different functions which caused various issues. Both functions have been merged
      together which should fix those issues, but keep an eye out for odd behaviours.
  - tweak: As a consequence of this change, Warping Claws as well as Spiked/Brass
      Knuckles prevent you now not only from using computers, but also now from firing
      guns.
  - tweak: Furthermore, methylin in humans counteracts the effects of brain damage,
      but no longer counteracts the handicap of wearing Warping Claws/Knuckles.
2020-11-13:
  Allspice:
  - bugfix: Add the starting runes to roundstart cultists' notes.
  - rscdel: Remove the buggy walk-over animation from the reveal rune.
  Blithering:
  - rscadd: the cargo merch store now stocks swiss army knives.
  DamianX:
  - tweak: 'Synergy: Fixed a bug that prevented brig cell lockers from being locked
      when the timer was activated, added fire extinguishers to the hallway, added
      mesons to maintenance tunnels.'
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Performing surgery with no dexterity (due for example to brain damage,
      or being a monkey with no methylin) gives you a chance to fail akin to being
      clumsy.
  - tweak: Data HUD range now depends on the client's view plus an overhead of 7 tiles,
      instead of a fixed 7 tiles. This overhead gives the HUD icons time to appear
      before the mob comes into view, drastically reducing the situations where you
      have to wait a second or two for it to appear.
  GreatBigFailure:
  - tweak: Butcher code has been butchered and stitched back together. Nothing has
      changed (yet) in terms of gameplay.
  PrimeDSS13:
  - tweak: Invisible people no longer have runechat appear over their head.
  gurfan:
  - tweak: 'Castle Station: Nuclear Operatives are three times more likely than usual
      to assault the station.'
  vtlevev1:
  - rscadd: New packed outpost for compact traders
2020-11-15:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Monkeys, Diona Nymphs, and other primitive carbons are now able to use
      their health as blood when performing cult rituals, without the need to acquire
      a syringe and a beaker. Each unit of blood taken translates to 1 oxy damage,
      which is negligible as long as small amounts are used, but can quickly kill
      you if if the ritual requires a lot of blood at once (such as resurrect).
  - rscadd: Aliens can use their blood as cultists as well by popular request. They
      cannot hold tomes though so writing full runes require a bit of effort. They
      take brute damage instead of oxy when writing runes but it's not like it matters
      since they heal all damage types over time by just standing over weeds.
  - rscadd: As a human cultist, you can now just grab a monkey just like you can grab
      a human to use their blood. Note that dead monkeys don't provide any more blood.
      Yes that means you can give them some Dexalin Plus to keep them as free blood
      dispensers, but then again so could you all this time when using a syringe and
      beaker.
  - tweak: Also monkeys now stop wandering around when grabbed with Grab Intent, just
      like when they're being pulled.
  - tweak: Constructs could already use runes that don't require a blood cost, however
      this limitation has been removed, giving constructs new purpose as a catalyst
      for low-cost rune rituals, as constructs can now pay the blood cost without
      having to actually produce any blood. Does this mean rune-drawing constructs
      down the line? I don't know. Not for now anyway (and not later without some
      limitations, Pale Bodies using stun runes is enough of a source of frustration
      already) We'll see how this goes first.
  - tweak: Shades can also use runes from now on, but only ones that don't have a
      blood cost (unless they find a splatter or bleeding corpse). As a side effect,
      so can Cult Blades, that can now fly through Path Runes.
  PrimeDSS13:
  - tweak: Pods no longer brick when you mess them up!
2020-11-17:
  BurntDevil:
  - rscadd: Internal Affairs and Lawyers now get the same command headset that Bridge
      Officers do.
  - rscadd: The IAA headset now includes security instead of just command.
  DamianX:
  - tweak: 'Bagelstation: the armory has been improved. It''s easier to navigate,
      and it''s got more stuff in it such as an ammolathe, a beepsky and holsters.
      Added a security camera console to the security office.'
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: 'Castle Station: Departments now have their own gun cabinets, each containing
      two tasers and four department specific guns. Service and civilian crewmembers
      start with guns as well.'
  - rscadd: 'Castle Station: Heads now get a stun revolver in their respective lockers.'
  - tweak: 'Castle Station: Updated the bar and the science suit storage units in
      EVA.'
  - rscadd: Changelings now use spells instead of verbs for all of their abilities.
2020-11-18:
  BurntDevil:
  - bugfix: Missing item state icon for new IAA headset fixed.
2020-11-19:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Beneficial Disease and Harmful Disease Centcomm Orders should now work
      as advertised.
  - bugfix: Fixed Toxic Compensation disease symptom that was creating toxic damage
      out of nothing.
  - rscadd: You can now strengthen or weaken the Toxic Compensation symptom to amplify
      or reduce the toxic feedback.
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where some helmets whose sprites supposedly completely
      hid the face with no transparency would somehow still let you know someone's
      gender/identity.
  - bugfix: Fixed Virology being basically completely gone from the game.
  jknpj:
  - bugfix: The spider clan started teaching their ninjas how to wear their masks
      properly.
2020-11-20:
  DamianX:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused some windoors to be open at round start when they
      should have been closed.
  HarseTheef:
  - bugfix: ironman donuts can be put into donut boxes now.
  - bugfix: Energy cutting weapons now properly keep firelocks open after a successful
      cut.
  - bugfix: Fixes being unable to color things purple with crayons, and a variety
      of other issues related to the color purple
  - tweak: Violet paint is now known as Purple paint
2020-11-21:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Dynamic Mode's roundstart ruleset rigging badmin tools have been fixed,
      allowing admin to force all rulesets at once if they so desire.
  - tweak: Improved Dynamic Mode logging. Should be easier to read and make sense
      of what happens now.
  HarseTheef:
  - tweak: Fixes the description of guac
  - rscadd: Adds modifying intercoms/hand-radios and construction/deconstruction back
  - bugfix: Fixes modifying intercoms/hand-radios
  SonixApache:
  - rscadd: You can now slap someone else in the mouth with a cigarette pack to hand
      them a cigarette
  - bugfix: Using a cigarette pack on your mouth no longer transmutes items into generic
      cigarettes
  vtlevev1:
  - rscadd: 'Packed: vox outpost has been rewired'
  - rscadd: 'Packed: minor fixes on the vox outpost, such as missing sinks.'
2020-11-22:
  HarseTheef:
  - bugfix: Fixes the name of the security records board
  - tweak: Fixes a typo in the ace reporter paper

2020-11-25:
  HarseTheef:
  - bugfix: The mad scientist megaphone user can no longer be tracked on cameras by
      silicons.
2020-11-26:
  DamianX:
  - tweak: 'Bagelstation: The brig used to have a digital valve connecting it to distro,
      now it''s a straight pipe instead.'
  PlausibleDeniability:
  - rscadd: The Suitlord 9000 has recently received a shipment of colored hoodies,
      try them out!
  - rscadd: 'Created Insectoid sprites for the following uniforms: AutoDrobe, PietyVend,
      Supply crates and most department lockers'
  - bugfix: There were a few insectoid sprites already in the DMI that didn't have
      its species_fit set, now working

      wizard dens.

  HarseTheef:

      vampire.

      headset.

      the time of death. (living cultists can still shade out anytime they want of
      course)
  - tweak: Shades now take 1hp of damage per Life() tick while in space, killing them
      in about one or two minutes. So no more sitting in space breaking windows.

  - tweak: When slicing a door open with an esword (harm intent), it now dismantles
      the door like a ram.
  - rscadd: Players may now use the "Get unique job" preference. This means it will
      not assign you to any job where someone else shares the same job slot. For example,
      if you high-pref botanist and there is already a botanist, it will try your
      medium preferences. If none of your preferences are empty, you will return to
      the lobby.
  - rscadd: Trees (such as those on Snaxi) become transparent when you are within

      try to use any logs on the ground before the one in your hand. It builds twice
      as fast if you clear the snow first.
  - tweak: When you build a new turf on unsimulated terrain, it will keep the same
      air mix, preventing ZAS while building.
  - rscadd: You can use one log on another to construct a storm door. Storm doors
      are wood doors that shut by themselves fairly quickly, keeping out the cold.
  - tweak: Pine logs are now worth 4 planks of wood, instead of just 2.
  - tweak: Asphalt roads now protect wires and pipes from being destroyed by explosions.
  - bugfix: Geysers now properly smoke (vents do not smoke) and heat you up based
      on your proximity to the geyser. Unstable geysers can burn you fairly easily,
      so be careful!
  - rscadd: Geysers can now melt nearby snow in a circle. Unstable geysers do it the
      fastest - melted snow? take it slow!
  - rscadd: You can shovel a geyser to fill it in and reduce the rate it puts out
      heat. Do it enough and you can seal it completely. Shovel a sealed geyser to
      completely remove it.
  - rscadd: Geysers hit by explosions can get sealed, but unstable geysers could go
      critical and spew out extreme heat. Call a suited atmospheric technician to
      seal it if this happens. Do not be tempted to build a thermoelectric generator
      around the critical geyser.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where geysers wouldn't transfer heat to simulated turfs.
  SonixApache:
  - tweak: 'Detomatix: Rather than blowing YOU up, failing a chance roll now outs

      for your species.
2021-01-20:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: New antag role! "Syndicate Challengers". Roughly based on the old
      double-agents game mode. Remember to update your preferences to try it out.
  - rscadd: Challengers are fairly similar to traitors in that they have an uplink,
      some TCs, even code words, however their single objective is to assassinate
      another challenger aboard the station, henceforth there's always at least 2
      of them tasked with killing each others. When there are more than 2 challengers,
      their assassination orders are chained so that the first one hunts the second
      one, the second one hunts the third one, etc, until the last one who hunts the
      first one. Once an assassination has been successfully carried out and reported
      to the Syndicate, you take on your victim's target (unless it was you in which
      case no more objectives are given) and receive 5 additional TCs.
  - rscadd: For a successful assassination to be permanently secured by the Syndicate,
      you must take a photo of your victim's dead (crit is enough) body, severed head,
      or brain, and publish it on any newscaster channel for all the crew to see their
      dead body. You can use any channel, but you may want to use your victim's ID
      to create one so as to keep the crew guessing as to your identity, or send the
      message with another stolen ID to send security on a red herring.
  - experiment: This variant on traitor puts the emphasis on robustness and direct
      confrontation between traitors, but the Syndicate doesn't care how the deed
      is performed so long as the kill is reported. Once it has, your victim's own
      assassination objective is forever marked as failed even if they get revived
      and their target dies later.
  - experiment: Cult conversions have been reworked! Details below.
  - experiment: The sounds produced by conversion runes can now only be heard by those
      who have a line of sight to the rune.
  - experiment: Automatic boxing now only happens to cult-banned players.
  - experiment: Refusing conversion now restrains you with ghastly bindings that hinders
      your movements through pain. It takes 1 minute to resist out of those.
  - experiment: Loyalty Implants no longer slow down conversions, but instead force-refuse
      them.
  - rscdel: Setting your cult preferences to Never no longer auto-refuses conversions
      (you now always get the choice) but still displays your preferences as such
      to Seer users.
  - rscadd: Non-cultists restrained by ghastly bindings show up on the altar's cult
      roster, and are valid Blood Magnetism targets (for both summoning and rejoining)
  - rscadd: The pain induced by ghastly bindings fades over time, but gets reset when
      their victim travels through the veil (Path or Blood Magnetism runes)
  - rscadd: The cultist who performed the conversion that restrained someone will
      instantly be informed should the bindings get removed. The bindings also remove
      themselves should another conversion attempt succeed.
  - tweak: Cultists no longer resist Loyalty Implanters, instead the implant pops
      out 10 seconds later.
  - tweak: All loyalty implanted cultists also get informed that they have 10 seconds
      before their implant pops out when Act 2 begins.
  - rscadd: Added holy implants. Can be ordered at cargo. Implanted cultists become
      unable to perform any ritual or use any cult spells. They also become unable
      to travel through the veil (Path Runes or Blood Magnetism) or be affected by
      Fervor. However they are destroyed upon conversion so they cannot be used preemptively
      unlike loyalty implants.
  - tweak: Cultists with holy water in their body will also suffer from those impediments.
  - experiment: Cult deconversions are a thing once again 2 years and a half later.
      They work as such, first have the cultist (or suspected cultist) take a sip
      of holy water (splashing them from the flask also works, or giving them a holy
      wafer to eat, etc). Immediately after slap them with a bible on help intent
      (the target needs to have over 20hp or it won't work). Everyone can do it, not
      just chaplains. If the target wasn't a cultist, nothing unusual happens. Otherwise
      they will be knockdown and given the choice to abandon the cult or resist. In
      both cases after 10 seconds, they take 10 brute damage, and a pair of red shades
      appear. If they accepted the deconversion, those shades will immediately start
      attacking them, otherwise if they resisted the shades will attack the one who
      attempted the deconversion, and other nearby non-cultists.
  - experiment: If a chaplain performed the deconversion with a bible of their religion,
      those red shades have 20hp and deal 5 damage, making them about as much of an
      inconvenience as blob spores. Otherwise they will be as strong as regular shades.
  - rscadd: Bibles, Holy Water, Incense, and Thuribles are now available from Cargo
      as Religious Paraphernelia under Supplies.
  - tweak: Cult mobs spawned by bloodstones no longer stand still for a while before
      attacking non-cultists, they instead immediately give chase once they spawn.
  - tweak: Blood Communion tattoo now also gives a small buff to blood regen.
  - bugfix: Fixed Confusion runes sometimes causing people to remain blinded forever
      when they time-out.
  - bugfix: Fixed deculted players still having cult UI elements on their screen
  - bugfix: Fixed splashing mobs with a holy water flask applying the equivalent of
      half the flask's current volume to them instead of only the 5u being spent.
  - bugfix: Fixed the holy water flask having wrong in-hand sprites when facing some
      directions.
  - bugfix: Using a soulstone on a cultist shade as a non-cultist now properly decults
      the shade.
  - rscadd: De-culted players now get a message specifying exactly what they remember
      about the cult, generally only the player who converted them.
  - rscadd: Cultists can now use altars as operating tables with the same efficiency
      as if they were using an actual operating table. Furthermore, Blood Daggers
      can now be used as ghetto scalpels and circular saws, and Talismans can be used
      as ghetto hemostats.

  - rscadd: Adds the changeling vial, stone mask, and the cult pamphlet to the traitor
      uplink for traitors that want to work together.

      or in the Vox outpost on Roid)
  - rscadd: There are now vaults to discover on the Snaxi outer reaches.
  - rscdel: Converted the old Santa cabin and construction site on Snaxi into random
      vaults.
  - tweak: Wolves won't lose nutrition until tamed, and tamed wolves will lose nutrition
      much slower.

      to tame.

      durations.
2021-01-29:
  BomberBro:
  - rscadd: Race car beds (and more) are now able to be made with 2 sheets of plasteel
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Added a clown language.
  HarseTheef:
  - rscadd: Adds the codebreaker to the 'cooperative cell' tab of the traitor uplink
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: On Snaxi, everyone spawns with a Snow Survival Guide (which links to the
      wiki page) in their backpack. The guide also reacts with snow to flash-ignite
      for a quick boost of heat.
2021-01-30:
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: Syndicate agents now have a tesla cannon available in their uplink.
2021-01-31:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Soulstone Shards can now be used to perform surgery as efficiently as
      glass shards.
  - bugfix: Fixed lasers bouncing off mobs when they should instead miss them (and
      the chat message properly appears once again)
  - bugfix: Fixed lasers no longer going through portals.
  - bugfix: Nuke Ops rejoice! Fixed clicking directly on a portal or teleporter hub
      with a ranged weapon causing the projectile to hit the portal instead of properly
      going through it. This should finally spell an end to nuke ops accidentally
      blowing themselves up trying to fire their RPG through their teleporter.
  - bugfix: Fixed an oversight that let cyborgs spawn as Syndicate Challengers.
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: When you build a snowman, it's just an inanimate structure (clearable with
      a single shovel). If you can give it a carrot nose and a magical hat, however,
      it will spring to life and give you gifts (gifts only first time that hat is
      used).
  ShiftyRail:
  - rscadd: Added tag mode! Changeling clown in a station of Mimes! More info on the
      wiki!
  SonixApache:
  - imageadd: Improved CMC damage number color contrast.
2021-02-01:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: The Gravity artifact effect now has a one second cooldown if activated
      through touch to prevent server-crashing infinite loops. Also this has technically
      been a feature since 2016, interesting it took this long to cause a crash.
  - tweak: When using a bible on someone with holy water in them, you and your target
      now have to stay still for 5 seconds before the ritual proceeds. Cultists get
      a big message in red warning them that someone is trying to deconvert them.
  - tweak: Non-chaplains performing deconversion will only knockdown cultists for
      half the duration.
  - tweak: Cultists with the Unholy Protection tattoo will be immune to the knockdown
      altogether.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Capitalised the first letter on "Ectoplasm" and "Diabeetusol" so they
      match the naming scheme (first letter uppercase)
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - rscadd: 'Roid: Added a substation next to the zoo and a few more AME parts so
      the station gets over the bump of power issues at roundstart.'
  Kromkar:
  - rscadd: Tweaks Black Site Prism; minor mapping changes, rebalances loot and adds
      Syndicate Exec mob. Changes Commandant Chuck Sneed to Buck Reed.
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: A few map fixes on Snaxi and its vaults.
  - bugfix: Capybaras have fixed movement.
  MintyEtude:
  - imageadd: Nanotrasen has spent an inordinate amount of money on new ore processing
      console screensavers so that the mining department can't file any abandonment
      complaints.
  SonixApache:
  - rscadd: Implanters and implant cases now tell you what implant is loaded in them
      upon examination.
  - rscadd: Implants now work properly when surgically implanted into people.
  - rscadd: Surgically removed implants can be put back into implant cases to make
      them implanter-compatible again.
  - rscdel: (syndicate) Implants now have a (high) chance to fizzle out upon removal.
  - bugfix: Implants no longer work when broken.
2021-02-03:
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - bugfix: Roidsubstation now requires engineering access.
  - tweak: Increased the size of packed mechanics office slightly.
  - bugfix: We found the missing SMES for packed Engineering. We predict this will
      reduce new engineers singuloosing on packed by 12:30 by 47.65%. Also changed
      some firelocks and wires to be more intuitive/easier to navigate and repair.
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: The armory is now on the proper power grid on Snaxi
  SonixApache:
  - imageadd: Changed armor vest sprites up a bit. For those who prefer the fat straps,
      use an armor vest on a secvend.
2021-02-04:
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - bugfix: Shame. Missing terminals.
  Sooose:
  - bugfix: Removed the ability to throw anvils with telekinesis.
2021-02-05:
  Exxion:
  - tweak: 'Windows are back to their pre-late-2018 behavior when moved: They maintain
      their direction again when moved instead of turning to face the direction of
      movement.'
  PJB3005:
  - bugfix: deadharvest artifact effect won't randomly break and correctly gets copied
      to artifact batteries.
  - bugfix: Admin rejuvenate no longer bulldozes various mutations like no breathing.
2021-02-06:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: The Pay2Use Large Artifact effect trigger can now only appear in a Primary
      Effect, never a Secondary Effect (because paying money is annoying enough that
      you shouldn't on top of that have only a 25% chance for it to activate the effect)
  - tweak: Large Artifacts featuring a Pay2Use primary effect trigger can now be summarily
      examined to see if they appear to feature a coin slot, bill acceptor, or card
      reader, since the Anomaly Analysis will otherwise give you the same results
      as a Touch or Reagent trigger, and such features should be noticeable to the
      naked eye anyway.
2021-02-07:
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Mimes now also know the Clown language, as per that whole "Clown-Mime
      War" thing.
  - tweak: 'Changed the Clown Language''s colour from #FBFF35 (Bright yellow) to #FF9FEF
      (Light Pink).'
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - tweak: Advanced Camera Consoles on all maps have been changed for regular Camera
      Consoles, with a board left behind in the warden's locker as an afterthought
      by the repo-man who downgraded them.
  Kharkov72:
  - imageadd: new bar sign, the hungry bug.
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: The shrunken vampire head can now be used inhand once per minute to screech
      and break glass within 1 tile. Unlike a real screech, this does not stun anyone.
  - tweak: The shrunken vampire head flash now pierces eye protection like vampire
      glare. It also has 7 force instead of 0.
  - tweak: The depocket wand is now small enough to fit in pockets.
  - tweak: The energy shotgun now indicates how to toggle its fire mode when examined
      (alt-click).
  - tweak: The autocuffer can now be used on orange shoes.
  - tweak: 'Removing cuffs from shoes now executes their removal effect (e.g.: explodes
      syndicuffs, deletes borg cuffs)'
  - rscadd: Traders are now selling a ricochet taser.
  PJB3005:
  - tweak: Xenoarch triangulation has no more maximum distance to find artifacts.
      Alden-Saraspovas still do like before. The idea here is that triangulation can
      now be used as a late-game tool if you're having trouble locating further artifacts
      with Saraspovas.
  - rscadd: Admin rejuvenate now re-attaches butts.
  - tweak: Vox and plasmamen can now safely use the xenoarchaeology essence printer.
  PrimeDSS13:
  - tweak: roomba stab cooldown is now five seconds as opposed to ten
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - rscadd: Added a new medical robot board that upgrades its surgery tools.
2021-02-08:
  MintyEtude:
  - imageadd: Some old bar signs [Saucy Clown, Clown's Head, The Damn Wall, Limbo]
      have been refurbished with shiny new neon tubing. Take a look around your local
      establishment next time the rest of the crew gets stone drunk off whiskey and
      starts blasting ancient showtunes throughout the station.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where you could literally not build cyborgs on Castlestation.
      Yes, this is a bug, this is not a feature, this is an unintended gameplay element
      that has been unfortunately cut out of the final product. You may now jeer as
      the only thing that kept security cyborgs on Castle at bay(station) was this
      bug, which is now gone, and now so is the fun.
2021-02-10:
  Kharkov72:
  - tweak: Janitors can use the door to disposals from the cargo lobby now.
  - bugfix: Amish suits on the floor should exist again.
  jellyveggie2:
  - tweak: You can now examine jukeboxes and sound systems to learn the name of the
      current song.
2021-02-11:
  Allspice:
  - tweak: Let wraiths use their jaunt spell by pressing the "use inhand item" button.
  beesil:
  - tweak: Changes threshold for flavor text to show a "more" button from 32 characters
      -> 64 characters.
2021-02-12:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Empty Soul Gems can now be fitted into a Construct Shell, turning it into
      a Shade Beacon. Roaming shades can use the beacon to become a construct without
      the need for another player to slot them inside the shell, allowing cultists
      to prepare those in preparation of a fight (because once Act 3 hits no cultist
      has time to make you a soul gem or a shell, let alone deal with you).
  - rscadd: Artificers can now slot Soul Gems (empty or full) in a construct shell
      if both are adjacent to them, by just clicking on the shell. You can also click
      the beacon to get the empty gem back.
  - tweak: Artificer health buffed from 50hp to 100hp. They're now a bit more sturdy
      than Wraiths (that only have 75hp) but still far from Juggernauts (250hp). This
      should help them survive more than two seconds once their base is getting broken
      into, they still suck in direct combat though.
  - rscdel: Wraiths can no longer fire bolts that nail mobs down in place.
  - rscadd: This nailing ability has been moved to thrown blood daggers.
  - rscadd: Wraith Phase Shift cooldown from 17 seconds to 15 seconds.
  - rscadd: Wraiths have a new Wraith Tear spell (with 7.5 seconds cooldown) that
      essentially gives them warping claws ability. Just like with warping claws you
      can channel the ability by toggling throw mode. The portals created by Wraith
      Tear only last 3 seconds and do not connect atmospheres, nor create sparks when
      they close. Non-cultist carbons who pass through them will experience 3 seconds
      of cult confusion, along with dizziness and other misc. effects. Lastly those
      portals leave a blood splatter behind them.
  - rscadd: Wraiths have now learned to write two runes specifically, Path Entrance
      and Path Exit. Each with a 60 seconds cooldown.
  - tweak: Wraiths damage has been nerfed from 25 brute to 15 brute.
  - experiment: The intent is to have Wraith perform more of a support role directly
      on the field, unlike Artificers that generally stay in base or Juggernauts that
      go straight into fights. By having two movement spells Wraiths can more easily
      get out of danger (they have the lowest HP of all constructs now) While the
      ability to write down Path Runes makes them a valuable asset to the cult beyond
      getting rid of a nosy AI.
  - imageadd: Wraiths also have a new Phase Shift animation.
  - bugfix: Fixed thrown blood daggers appearing with an incorrect sprite when created
      using non-red blood.
  Sooose:
  - bugfix: All heads of staff can now fax Nanotrasen HR to demote or commend employees.
  coldud13:
  - bugfix: Snaxi gateway room now accepts either teleporter or gateway access.
2021-02-13:
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: There is now a santa bag type that doesn't spawn infinite gifts.
2021-02-16:
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - tweak: People with morgue access can now no longer use the morgue interior door
      as a shortcut to sneak into medbay.
  - rscdel: Security checkpoint on deff has door into medbay removed to keep in line
      with the new policy.
2021-02-21:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: the Juggernaut construct's shield that protects it from weapons of force
      10 and below now also protects it from similarly weak thrown items, punches,
      and projectiles.
  - tweak: HOWEVER its armor goes away completely when it loses a third of its health
      (and cracks begin to appear, as explained below). The armor comes back when
      the juggernaut is healed past the threshold by an artificer.
  - imageadd: A visual cue and sound appear whenever an attack gets successfully blocked
      by a juggernaut's shield
  - imageadd: Constructs now have luminous cracks visibly appear on their shell as
      they take damage. They have two different cracked states, each reached after
      losing another third of their health. (and of course getting healed by an artificer
      will remove those cracks)
  - imageadd: Slightly improved the ectoplasm sprite, so it looks both better on the
      floor, and is easier to click.
  - imageadd: Ectoplasm spawned from shattered constructs will now be of the same
      color as the eyes of the construct it came from.
  - bugfix: The ghosts of dead constructs or shades no longer appear like grey piles
      of dust.
  toomykins:
  - rscadd: added "get belt" verb
2021-02-22:
  Allspice:
  - tweak: Also let juggers and artis use one of their spells by clicking the "activate
      held object" button.
  Eneocho:
  - rscdel: Removed Solanine from Ambrosia Cruciatus
  - rscdel: Removed Solanine from Amborsia Vulgaris
  - rscdel: Removed Cytisine from Ambrosia Deus
  - rscadd: Added Phytocarisol and Kathalai to Ambrosia Deus
  - rscadd: Added Cytisine to Death Berries.
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: An antimatter containment jar with 10x the normal capacity is now available
      at cargo
  HarseTheef:
  - rscadd: Adds the Sniper/Spotter team bundle to the uplink under the new Elite
      Syndie Bundle option
  ShiftyRail:
  - rscadd: During Blood Cult, one cultist is the chief of the Cult and can talks
      directly to other cultists by using ":x". He gets also a special HuD icon.
2021-03-02:
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: Jukeboxes, transmitters, and uranium tiles/walls/doors now provide power
      to radiation collectors. Jukebox engine patent pending.
2021-03-04:
  Apogee-dev:
  - rscadd: Body scanners can now be emagged to irradiate their occupant.
  - rscadd: Sleepers can now be emagged to disable overdose protection and give fake
      readouts if a patient is being overdosed.
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: New items added to the merch computer. Including a cheap soap guaranteed
      for 20 uses (and then has a progressively increasing chance of melting away),
      and Sterile Masks, that come in the usual medbay variety along with a more sober
      black variant, and a terribly clowny colorful variant.
  - rscadd: Sterile Masks can now be moved away from your face like breath masks can.
      Doing so will null their sterility factor until you put it back on properly.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Lossetta stone now can teach Clownish as well.
  - rscadd: Holy water works the same as water when mixed with potassium.
  - rscadd: Holy water-potassium explosions play a HALLELUJAH sound effect.
  - rscadd: Holy water-Potassium explosions are slightly stronger than regular water-potassium
      explosions.
  N3X15:
  - rscadd: Added a bunch of new words to VOX announcements.
  PavelCIA:
  - rscadd: Adds the "Impostor" character from the 2018 hit video game "Among Us"
  ShiftyRail:
  - tweak: The time limit for the vox raiders heist has been doubled. (From 30 minutes
      to 60 minutes)
  Squird5:
  - rscadd: Rotated the belt in a dumb way that actually worked.
  - rscadd: Rebuilt the Centcom Cargo Dock so the shuttle doesn't have to flip, bugging
      the conveyors. Conveyors now work!
  - rscadd: Swapped out basic lights for HE lights in Botany
  - rscadd: Added QMLoad tags to the associated conveyors
  TurboGay:
  - rscadd: adds the mudslide drink/reagent/sprite
  - rscadd: adds the boysenberry blizzard drink/reagent/sprite
  - rscadd: adds the sacrificial mary drink/reagent/sprite
  - rscadd: adds the creamy hot chocolate drink/reagent/sprite
  ancientpower:
  - tweak: Hyperzine increases internal and external bleeding by roughly 30%
  coldud13:
  - tweak: Be careful about kicking guns around!
  kane-f:
  - bugfix: Ghosts no longer make security alerts screens hide warnings by interacting
      with them.
  - tweak: Priority announcements now make a sound when they appear in chat
  - bugfix: Diona nymphs wearing bags of holding now properly create singularities
      if put inside another bag of holding.
2021-03-06:
  giraffism:
  - rscadd: Adds in wolf headdress, just skin a wolf and you can have your very own
      wolf headdress!
  - rscadd: Wolves now have teeth to be removed
2021-03-09:
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: Castlestation will now prevent you from creating AI and Cyborgs. Unholy
      magics that mess with the fabric of reality are unaffected.
  - tweak: The MK2 medical cyborg upgrade now also doubles the storage capacity for
      brute kits, burn kits and splinters.
2021-03-11:
  Apogee-dev:
  - tweak: Lightswitches are now turned off by default.
  - tweak: Lightswitches check for players at roundstart and turn on if there are
      any present.
  DeityLink:
  - soundadd: Added a Funk playlist to the jukebox, courtesy of Dickwrath.
  - soundadd: Added a brand new Shoegaze playlist to the jukebox. With lots of reverb
      for that big old bar feel.
  - imageadd: Revamped the vinyl sprite. The label in the center is still red by default
      but can be customized for each different playlist.
  - experiment: Player-controlled Giant Spiders now have some sort of color-matrix
      powered night vision that lets them see quite well in the dark while still being
      able to identify lit areas, and therefore to seek lights to destroy. Might refine
      later. Feedback welcome.
  - rscadd: Player-controlled Giant Spiders have a brand new HUD, featuring a health
      indicator, a fire warning, and a zone selection (for choosing which limb to
      target on humans). Spiderlings also have an indicator for their growth, while
      Nurse have indicators for both how many eggs they can lay, and how many spiders
      there are in total, as well as how many are needed before they can evolve into
      a Queen.
  - rscadd: Player-controlled spiderlings are now able to ventcrawl (turns out they
      couldn't until now, despite NPC spiderlings being one of the only mob actually
      having an AI that lets it ventcrawl)
  - rscadd: Player-controlled Giant Spiders now have spells for all their abilities
      that can be cast by players should they end up controlling one. This includes
      Spiderlings growing up (they get to choose whether to become Guard, Nurse or
      Hunter), as well as Nurse spinning webs, cocoons, laying eggs, and evolving
      into queens
  - tweak: Spider hunters are now twice faster, still slower than carps though.
  - rscadd: Changed the requirements and logic behind spider nurses evolving into
      queens. Before nurses would instantly become queens if there were less than
      5 queens in the world. Now there has to be at least 10 spiders total (including
      spiderlings) per queen in the world for an NPC nurse to evolve. It will then
      have a 10% chance per second to evolve. Player-controlled nurses only require
      6 spiders per queen, ensuring that NPC nurses shouldn't cuck players out of
      becoming queens. As a side-effect, non-queen nurses will become more common
      once again.
  - rscadd: Spider queen projectiles no longer deal 5 brute damage, instead they root
      mobs to the floor just like blood nails do. As for those, resisting or clicking
      the webs will let you break out after one or two seconds. The queen can fire
      her projectile about every three or four seconds at best (BYOND time is uncertain).
  - bugfix: Fixed the giant spider queen's projectile being invisible
  - bugfix: Fixed NPC spider nurses laying two egg clusters when they should only
      be able to lay one, causing them to birth twice as many spiderlings as normal.
  plosky1:
  - rscadd: Lowfat Bagel is now available. I hope you all lose some weight from it.
2021-03-13:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Syndicate code words not being highlighted in red for challengers.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Clean SE Centcomm Order from being impossible to complete.
  - bugfix: Through the magic of icon operations, not only are Medibots once again
      of the color of the first-aid kit used to build them, but this time ALL first-aid
      kit variants are supported, as the bot's icon is generated from the kit's icon.
  - tweak: Medibots no longer give different reagent depending on the first-aid kit
      used to build them, instead they now all give the "better" reagent corresponding
      to the damage type instead of tricord.
2021-03-14:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed the new cheap soap and face mask items being conspicuously absent
      from the merch computer.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Added an Insecticide reagent.
  - rscadd: Insecticide reagent poisonous to bugmen and bugmonkeys, to the same degree
      as plant-b-gone is poisonous to Dionae and dionae nymphs.
  - rscadd: Insecticide bottles on Nutrimax vendor.
  - rscadd: Antitox and Allicin treat Insecticide poisoning.
  - rscadd: Plant-B-Gone and Insecticide on Biogenerator, at 35 Nutriment for 10u,
      dispensed on inserted beaker.
  - rscadd: Insecticide kills cockroaches, mutroaches, spiderlings and bees.
  - rscdel: Removed Pest Spray from Nutrimax vendor.
  N3X15:
  - bugfix: Fixed grammatical error in the connection loss announcement.
  ShiftyRail:
  - tweak: Snow Taxi is now only available during the months of December, January,
      February, and July.

  - rscadd: Changed mismatched id tags to matching id tags for Dorm 1's door and button
  - rscadd: Added two new lamps into the Bar and Kitchen area to minimize shadowed
      areas
  - rscadd: Upgraded the Botany lamps to HE bulbs for consistency
  kane-f:
  - rscadd: Sticking a fork in an open APC now shocks the user.
  - bugfix: Trader uplinks can now be loaded with telecrystals to refund.
2021-03-18:

  - rscadd: 'The gourmonger: A food-based engine for chefgineers.'
2021-03-19:
