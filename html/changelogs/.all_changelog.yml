      stations etc.
  - bugfix: Also fixed Cyborgs and MoMMIs being able to weld/unweld a locker from

2016-06-10:
  Albinobigfoot:
  - tweak: You can now grab an item from your inventory by clicking on its storage
      slot, as if you had selected the item's pixel itself.
  - tweak: This works for items in storage (e.g. backpacks, boxes, bags, etc.), items
      on your person (e.g. pockets, suit storage, belt slot, etc.), as well as borg
      and mommi modules.
  - rscadd: Adds a prisoner Plasma Man suit and helmet. Complete sets can be found
      in regular prisoner dress lockers.
  Intigracy:
  - rscdel: Cuban pete no longer gives you a free bomb when you beat him via emagged
      arcade.
  - tweak: The maracas Pete gives you for beating him are now by default emagged,
      meaning when you throw them at something they explode.
  - tweak: Buffed the emagged maraca explosion. It will now cause a hull breach if
      thrown at a floor, and will gib dead bodies. It deals about 100 damage when
      thrown at mobs.
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Adds a new type of secure locker, the vault locker. Vault lockers are
      immovable, explosion-proof, EMP-proof, and have 100 times the health of a standard

  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: 'Added targeted use for hailers: You can now click on people to hail at
      them, like you would click to shoot a gun or throw an item. Directly hailing
      at someone will give them a big red bold message telling them to halt, and will
      specifically call them out by name in chat with the line ''(You) hails for X
      to halt!''. This also has aim assist in the form of working in a 3x3 square
      around where you clicked, to make it easier to hail moving targets.'
  - imageadd: New Hailer warning sprites courtesy of Blithering.
  - rscadd: MoMMI material synthetizers can now scan wooden planks, plastic sheets,
      and carpet tiles. They still cannot scan anything else. Likewise, borg/human

  - rscadd: Added four new plants, specific to the Seed 'n' Feed. They are Breadfruit,
      Woodapple, Chicken of the Stars, and Garlic.

      they go together like chicken and gravy.

  - bugfix: Fixed an edge-case issue where people were mistakenly believing that N3X15
      made a changelog entry recently.

  cumoverme:
  - rscadd: 'Added six new hairs: Long Ponytail, High Ponytail, Side Ponytail 1, Side

  DrCelt:
  - tweak: changes the effect of high pressure on heat loss.
  - tweak: disables high pressure heat loss multiplier effect on ventcrawling mobs.
  Exxion:
  - tweak: Bandoliers are now accessories rather than exosuits. This means they attach
      directly to your jumpsuit rather than taking up your exosuit slot. They can
      be removed with the Remove Accessory verb. You should be able to figure out
      how to use them. Note that, like other storage accessories, they must be removed
      in order to take the jumpsuit off by yourself.
  - bugfix: Fixes storage accessories not being visible on jumpsuits in the inventory.
  Faptastic:
  - rscadd: The miner borg module now has a destination tagger and package wrap.

  - spellcheck: TYPOS have been FIXED.
2016-06-17:
  ArthurDentist:
  - rscadd: The cloning Console can now be emagged. Emagging the Cloning Console will
      allow you to edit the records of people who have been scanned allowing you to
      change their name or species.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - rscadd: Massively expanded the Vox Outpost for the benefit of the traders there
  - tweak: Changed the Courtroom significantly. You'll need to use the TV Monitors
      to watch the proceedings properly (won't be able to see judge from seats) but
      they broadcast speech and the seats, so it's functionally identical
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Borers can now inhabit a human's left arm, right arm, left leg, right
      leg, and chest in addition to their head. A human may have one borer in each
      of these limbs. The borer's available evolutions are influenced by the limb
      it is currently inhabiting.
2016-06-18:
  9600bauds:
  - experiment: The following changes required a lot of rewriting and refactoring
      of old-ass code. I've tested this as best as I could, but if you notice any
      bugs still, please don't hesitate to make a bug report!
  - rscadd: Trying to put an item in the wrong slot via the stripping menu now gives
      an explicit error message, so as to not waste your time.
  - tweak: 'Buffed the Pickpocket''s Gloves: Their effects now apply to all storage
      slots, not just ID and pockets.'
  - rscadd: You can now toggle someone's suit sensors via the stripping menu, without
      having to remove their jumpsuit.
  - tweak: There is now one unified option to toggle other people's internals via
      the stripping menu, which is available even if they have a tank in their pockets
      or hands.
  - tweak: 'Simplified the way toggling internals chooses a tank: It will now simply
      look in your suit storage, then back, then belt, then pockets, then hands. It
      will also only take internals from a jetpack as last option.'
  - bugfix: Fixed items in your pocket slots not applying their on_found() effects
      (e.g. mousetraps) when stripped individually, only when your jumpsuit was stripped.
  - bugfix: Fixed items in your pocket slots not applying their on_stripped() effects
      (e.g. SPS) when your jumpsuit was stripped, only individually.
  - rscdel: Removes the ability to perform CPR on alien larvas. Sorry guys.
  - bugfix: Accidentally fixed bug where you could spam CPR and do CPR multiple times
      at the same time in the same mob. Sorry guys.
  - bugfix: Fixed borers (or any other simple animals you can't control normally)
      never decreasing their deaf/confused/blind timers, thus being forever deaf/confused/blind.
  - bugfix: Borers will no longer be blinded by flashbangs if their host has flash
      protection (since they're seeing out of their host's eyes and whatnot).
2016-06-19:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed the first Xenoarch large artifact ever scanned becoming forever
      unmovable if a second large artifact was scanned afterwards or if the analysis
      was cancelled.
2016-06-20:
  DrCelt:
  - bugfix: fixes asspies to not contain spiritbreaker to bring behaviour like assburgers
  DrCelt / Intigracy:
  - bugfix: (DrCelt) Fixed a bug where species damage modifiers were applied twice.
  - tweak: (DrCelt) As a result of this, brute/burn modifiers are slightly less effective
      when it comes to resistance/weakness (less damage resisted, less damage taken,
      respectively)
  - tweak: (Intigracy) Dionae burn damage is an exception, it has changed from 6.25
      to 6.2
2016-06-21:
  Icantthinkofanameritenow:
  - bugfix: Fixed Vox Engineer hardsuit helmets lacking welding protection.
  - bugfix: Vox atmospherics hardsuits should protect against plasma exposure and

      beerkegs wrenchable.
  Shadowmech88:
  - tweak: The utility borer's fleshshot now requires 10 chems to fire if the borer
      is using it to swing an item. It costs nothing if the host's hand is empty.
  - tweak: Utility borers are now incapable of using their fleshshot while their host
      is stunned, or has silicate in their system.
  - rscadd: Borers will now take damage while their host has sodium chloride in their
      system, and will die from it after roughly 40 seconds.

  - rscadd: Borers can now see their health in the status tab.
  - tweak: Plasmamen now take 1.5x brute damage.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added a new hostile monster - legionary hoppers. Their ability to leap
      on top of their foes makes up for their slower speed. The hostile infestation
      event can bring up to 8 of them to the station.
  - tweak: 'Tomb of Rafid updates:'
  - rscadd: Added a new area - the Water Gallery
  - bugfix: Fixed rock walls creating cold vacuum, fixed being able to crowbar water
      turfs
  - tweak: Slightly reduced damage done by fire blasts (affects fire traps, jackal
      firebreathers and pyromaniacs)
  - bugfix: Fixed cyborgs being able to use ladders. They can still enter the tomb
      through the second entrance
2016-06-22:
  DrCelt:
  - bugfix: Changed behaviour of grey telepathy to not be awful and highly exploitable.
  - tweak: You now have to hear someone speak locally - in other words, you have to
      see their speech bubble, before you can telepathically communicate with them.
  - tweak: The name chosen to represent them in the menu is the one you heard them
      speak as.
  - rscadd: If you examine someone they will be added to your options as well.
  - tweak: You can no longer discover if someone is dead by trying to send them a
      message.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Diona burn mod is now 2.5 again. Apparently the way burn mod was applied
      before wasn't as expected.
  Ririchiyo:
  - wip: added dectalk
  Shadowmech88:
  - tweak: Food items can now be loaded into the blunderbuss and the cannon. Drinks
      can as well, as long as the container isn't open.
2016-06-24:
  Sood:
  - rscadd: Aliens can now alt-click on mobs to spit neurotoxin at them.
  - rscadd: Aliens can now ctrl-click on other aliens to transfer plasma to them.
  - tweak: Spit neurotoxin now has a cooldown. Yes, it didn't before. That's how clunky
      that menu was.
2016-06-25:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed wallets hiding your identity when worn in your ID slot even if they
      had an ID put inside.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: There is now a more noticable difference between knives and kitchen knives
      now, the former is known as small knife and has a new icon. It still doesn't
      work for making swords.
  Shadowmech88:
  - imageadd: Added new borg sprites for the standard, service, security, and combat
      modules, courtesy of Dizor.
  Unid:

      up when they should be able to

  JustSumBody:
  - rscadd: Quick equip will now prioritize placing items into equipped belts over
      pockets and suit storage.
  Unid:
  - bugfix: Crushing locked crates by shuttles now destroys their contents as well.
2016-06-28:
  Sood:
  - rscadd: Adds a marker. The necromorph kind. Currently admin spawn only.
  - rscadd: Players can click on the marker with their bare hand to become a necromorph,
      or drag another mob onto it to turn it into a necromorph.
  - rscadd: Ghosts can sign up to be a necromorph by clicking on the marker. They
      will take control of the next mindless necromorph to spawn.
  - tweak: Player necromorphs can now open doors.
2016-06-29:
  Kurfurst:
  - rscadd: Added three new Vox plants to fill missing botanical niches, Slippery
      Pitcher Plants, Aloe Vera, and Vapor Sacs.
  - rscadd: Added Box (plural Boxen), freakish boarlike livestock for Vox to farm.
  - rscadd: Added a Box Flesh Cloner and the Box meat it runs on, with which to clone
      fresh Box babies. Surely recloning the same meat again and again over untold
      generations won't cause the rise of some antediluvian horror.
  - rscadd: Added seven new Vox food recipes, bacon, pork tenderloin, sweet and sour
      pork, hobo burger, welcome pie, zhu long cao fan, poached aloe, mint, vapor
      stew.

      to turn reagents to gas.

      Contraband, Boxen starter kit added to Premium
  - tweak: Special thanks to all the spriters who contributed to the Vox hydroponics
      project, most prominently Inorien.
2016-06-30:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Reverse-stripping items into monkeys is instantaneous again.
  - tweak: Reverse-stripping items into humans is now 50% faster, since 4 seconds
      per slot is very tedious and the shorter time is not really very exploitable
      anyways.
  Kurfurst:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug with inheritance that caused woodapples to be reharvestable
      infinitely
  - tweak: Based on feedback, reduced vapor salt production significantly.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where any plant with images in hydroponics2.dmi would disappear
      when modified. These included diona nodes, Vox plants, cinnamonum.

  - bugfix: Phazon floors now affect all types of mobs, not only a few of them
2016-07-07:
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: The admin spawnable autogibber now actually works. I recommend not walking
      into it, trying to touch it with a tool, or trying to touch it with your hand.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Double agents now have a 20% chance to receive an objective to assassinate
      a civilian (non-antagonist). When such an objective is given, another double
      agent receives an objective to protect the civilian.
2016-07-10:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Added boot knife holsters. Currently, they can be found inside Security
      lockers, and come preloaded with a 10 force knife.
  - imageadd: Boot knife holster sprites courtesy of Blithering. Tactical knife sprite
      stolen from Bay when noone was looking.
  - tweak: The Biogenerator can now make handgun holsters, as well as the new boot
      knife holster.
  - tweak: Medals and ties can now be attached to spacesuits, armor, and anything
      that goes over your chest. Because why not?

  - rscadd: The service borg dice have been replaced with a digital die, change dice

      3 seconds.
  - tweak: Cult blades found through Xenoarchaeology no longer require you to be a

  - rscadd: Gave the tile painter the ability to clear decals on a tile.
2016-07-14:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to set someone else's suit sensors through a hardsuit.
      Also made the 'set suit sensors' button smaller to prevent accidental clicking
      when mashing every button on the strip menu after you stun that guy.
  kolith:
  - rscadd: Adds a secway vehicle. It behaves as a janicart, except that you crash
      into things and are stunned for a short time if you are clumsy or very drunk.
  - rscadd: Adds a foam armblade toy. It can be acquired as a prize from an arcade
      machine.
  ultraPLEN:
  - rscadd: Added modular couches contstructable from metal sheets.
  - bugfix: Fixed an overlay issue with roller chairs
2016-07-17:
  PJB3005:
  - bugfix: Fixes the R-UST and shield generator circuits being broken and unable
      to be built into machinery. You've got the author of Bus Station to thank for
      that.
2016-07-18:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed MoMMIs being able to drop held items while ventcrawling, which would
      make the dropped item magically pop out on the floor above the vent.
  JustSumGuy:
  - bugfix: 'The High-res camera module for Malf AI now once again lets you read lips
      as long as their mouth is unobstructed. '

2016-07-22:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where limbs that had burn damage would not be severed from
      the body via brute damage. This was most commonly seen when trying to decapitate
      people that were lasered.
  - rscadd: Trying to put a brain in a MMI now produces a special message telling
      you to try again if the brain has ghosted but can still rejoin their body, much
      like how cloners work with corpses. When this happens, the ghosted player will
      get bwoinked and told to rejoin their corpse.
  - bugfix: Fixed the message you get when examining a brain, which was supposed to
      differentiate brains with a player still inside and brains belonging to a ghosted
      player.
  - bugfix: Fixed Diona nymphs not regenerating health from bright lights. Note that
      their health regen is much much slower than grown Diona. Did not 'fix' the way
      they take damage from darkness, meaning they still pretty much just don't.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Supermatter crates ordered from cargo now cost 500 credits, as opposed
      to 100.
  JustSumGuy:
  - bugfix: The 'Box Cloner' is now properly built from a machine frame rather than
      a computer frame.
  - tweak: Removed the overdose limit on imidazoline, and by extension carrots.
2016-07-24:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: All-in-One Grinders will now try to start grinding their ingredients when
      alt-clicked, and only eject their beaker if no ingredients are loaded (previously
      they would only eject their beaker).
  JustSumGuy:
  - bugfix: Made the food tray more like a table, add items to trays by clicking on
      the tray with the item in hand. Trays drop all their items upon being placed
      on a table,thrown, or dropped.
  mph55:
  - bugfix: Fixed an unreported bug which items removed from the switchtool were stuck
      on your hands after being picked up.
2016-07-27:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed Vox Raider dart guns not firing when clicking on a turf, which made
      aiming hell. Also, to prevent confusion and birdbrains unwittingly firing empty
      darts, the dartguns start mixing reagents by default.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - tweak: All chairs, wooden and metal, are now worth 1 sheet (both construction
      and deconstruction), down from 5/3/2/1 (Office, Wooden, Comfy, Normal)
  JustSumGuy:
  - tweak: Vampire's enthrall ability now requires both the vampire's and the target's
      masks to be removed. Enthrall can no longer be used while restrained.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added pop out cakes - enormous cakes that are big enough for a human to
      hide inside. Inside of it is a one use party string - pull it to sound the party
      horns and graciously climb out of the cake. Cutting them with a knife produces
      edible slices.
  - rscadd: Pop out cakes can be bought for 3 telecrystals by nuclear operatives,
      or cooked in the microwave using 15 milk, 45 flour, 6 eggs and 6 sheets of cardboard.
  mph55:
  - bugfix: The character preview is no longer blurry.
2016-07-31:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Trying to clone a husk now provides a more informative error message, rather
      than the generic 'mental interface failure'. This message also tells you if
      the dead guy can still rejoin their corpse, so you can try to clone a husk before
      attempting a head transplant and know you're not wasting your time on someone
      that already logged out.

      the cooldown upgrade lowers it to 1 second). When cast, you will create a magical
      golem and infuse it with your mana and knowledge. The golem will possess basic,
      unupgraded versions of every spell you know.'
  - rscadd: Forge Arcane Golem and Mind Transfer can't be learned by golems.
  - rscadd: Whenever you cast a spell, all of your arcane golems will cast it too.
      Targeted spells are cast at the same target. Golems ignore spell cooldowns,
      and can cast spells as often as their master can.
  - rscadd: Only 1 golem can exist at once. This limit may be raised by 1 by upgrading
      the spell, up to 2 times (for a maximum of 3 golems). Casting the spell when
      too many golems already exist will teleport all of your golems to you instead.
  - rscadd: Arcane golems permanently follow you, are slow, have 50 health and can't
      attack. When a golem dies, all of its masters' spells go on cooldown as if they
      were cast.

      contact your local HoP for details.

      planks), out of marble blocks (imported from cargo), or built with parts from
      the exosuit fabricator. This last one features a locked cover similar to the
      one display cases have.
  - rscadd: Wooden and Marble mannequins can currently be sculpted in the form of
      a human, a fat human, a monkey, or a vox.
  - rscadd: You can place clothes on mannequins the same way you'd place clothes on
      a mob. If mannequins are broken, they drop their clothes.
  The-Albinobigfoot:

      the old damage values, so you had to apply nanopaste to fix it. Now you don't
  - bugfix: This also fixes a bug where power cell damage can't be fixed (because
      of a stupid loop). You still have to place a new power cell though.
2016-10-30:

      perfectly fine.
  - tweak: When locked in cages, AI aliens aren't able anymore to plant weed sacks,
      eggs, or beds. Queens can still spit acid to adjacent walls when angered but
      that can be prevented by closing the cover.

      before MoMMI spawns.

      will see the firer as its new master, allowing wizards to take their ownership
      from other wizards for instance.
  - rscadd: Added a new mob, the Living Mannequin. Mannequins will awaken when hit
      by a bolt of animation. Additionally, I've added a few variables that allow
      mappers to create mannequins that automatically awaken when they spawn, or when
      a mob walks next to them, or when you try to strip them, and that make nearby
      mannequins awaken as well. Destroying a Living Mannequin drop their items. If
      the mannequin was holding a highly damaging item when it woke up, it'll fight
      using that item. It doesn't have the dexterity to fire guns however.
  - rscadd: Added cult mannequins. They appear when Nar-Sie cultifies a mannequin.

      their owner and other nuke ops.

      thanks to Intigracy
