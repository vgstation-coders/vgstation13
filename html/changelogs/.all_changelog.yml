      to check which path they were attuned to.

      a blood cost will require an external blood source. Summon Robes doesn't do
      anything when used by constructs.
  - rscadd: Cult monkeys now have access to the cult spells, allowing them to write
      runes (though they need an external blood source, since monkeys don't have proper

      it into yourself. This works even if you're not holding it.

      ways) anything that wasn't a mob. This may have slight balance implications

      retain their remaining combustible when extinguished.

      of extra duration. The thurible also comes with a built in lighter.
  - tweak: the vampire smiting abilities of the null rod have been moved over to the
      thurible (since it's made of silver). Null rods can still disrupt their powers.
      Thuribles also deal brutal damage to undead simple animals, such as zombies.
  - bugfix: The character preference preview now properly displays chaplains with
      laceups shoes.
  - rscadd: The cult holomap is now accessible from altars, and displays the position

      the HoP's office!
  - rscadd: The PDA station map app has been revamped to work just like a portable
      station holomap. It still gives your coordinates when used, but you may no longer
      place markers on it, but frankly until there is a significant demand for it
      I'll bury that feature. On the bright side this means it now works on all maps
      and automatically updates with all map changes.

  - tweak: Denser mining turfs are now much more resistant to explosives

      nest more freely among the 'roids. Crew are advised to be more cautious of deep

      damsel in distress?
  - rscadd: Added waifu and secfu corpses which other mappers may find useful.
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: Sending one midround wizard now costs 20 threat (down from 50) and destroying
      it refunds 10 (down from 40).
  - tweak: Blobstorms are now much cheaper, require less extreme conditions to fire,
      and get a fake meteor warning at first (as well as more delay before announcing
      it was a blobstorm after all); roundstart blobs remain the same

      added

      of level 1 default research in the multiplier calculation.

      nothing, but now it will make you regenerate twice as fast but make you go hungry
      twice as fast!
  - bugfix: Fixed turning internal organs between organic and robotic process not

      indicator disappears once the stun is over, or the victim dead.

      or picking a talisman using the radial menu. This does NOT bring up the pop-up.

      can technically still get back afterwards thanks to the Resurrect rune)"'

      that they can soulstone the people they sacrifice by using an empty soul blade.

      It has to be the real deal vodka ala tunguska triple distilled, not derivatives
      or knock-offs!
  - tweak: The more russian you are, the bigger the explosion when it inevitably decides
      to blow up instead of reducing the explosion!
2019-03-05:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that let a crew-member that refused conversion be designed
      as sacrifice target the instant before they get devoured.
  - tweak: Removed the cooldown on sacrifice target re-roll, instead, any cultist
      may now force a re-roll at an altar by communing with Nar-Sie if the target
      either had their body destroyed, or fled the station's Z level. This means that
      the cult may now confirm that their target is still around the station.

  - rscadd: Added rabbits. They don't do or say much other than look cute.
  Exxion:
  - bugfix: Fixed two ancient bugs that caused fires to burn hotter and release more
      CO2 than intended. Fires in general are now much colder and produce much, much
      less pressure. This affects bombs as well. Since six years of balance happened
      since these bugs were introduced, some numbers are probably going to have to
      be tweaked.
  SirSkeleto:
  - rscadd: Harm attacking a cablecuffed spaceman will NO LONGER break the cablecuffs,
      and instead stab the target.

  Irradiation:
  - tweak: Midround Blob(Storm)'s weight has been reduced, making it a bit less likely
      to roll at that time.

      to roll at that time.

  - rscadd: Adds an optional locking module for spacepods.
  ShiftyRail:
  - tweak: '"Added the *High Threat* setting to the HuD list. It is meant to be used

      and ask questions later. Sprites courtesy of @otatoh."'
2019-03-09:
  Exxion:
  - tweak: Almost doubled energy released per mole of reactant in fires, again. This
      should bring bombs and burn chambers back to roughly where they were before,
      or only slightly lower. This also affects all other fires, but any time the
      ratio of reactants to total gas is low, they'll still be far weaker than before.
      (If you see this message but don't observe the effects in-game, blame whoever
      merged the PR)
  Irradiation:
  - tweak: Malfunctioning AIs can now occur dynamically midround with incredibly low
      odds. Dead/Low Lowpop can't roll midround MALF.
  MadmanMartian:
  - tweak: Destroying all the blob cores no longer ends the round entirely. Instead,
      it removes the lockdown upon death.

  - tweak: Roundstart ruleset weights have been adjusted. Overall there will be more
      traitors, less nuke ops and malf.
  - tweak: High danger (potentially round ending) roles have had their ruleset costs
      increased, which lowers the chance of them happening at the same time.

      levels that should never allow it.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixes the Sith bundle Sith Lightning appearing in the wizard's spellbook
