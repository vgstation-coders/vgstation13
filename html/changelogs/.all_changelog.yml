  I-VAPE-VOX-CLOACA-EVERY-DAY-OF-MY-LIFE:
  - bugfix: The Janitor's trash bag can now hold up to 21 items, as intended. To prevent
      it from becoming the ultimate belt slot container, it will slow you down if
      it's too full and worn on belt slot (won't slow you down if you're just carrying
      it or if you clip it to your janicart)
  MadmanMartian:

      of extra duration. The thurible also comes with a built in lighter.
  - tweak: the vampire smiting abilities of the null rod have been moved over to the
      thurible (since it's made of silver). Null rods can still disrupt their powers.

      laceups shoes.

      station holomap. It still gives your coordinates when used, but you may no longer

  - tweak: Denser mining turfs are now much more resistant to explosives

  - tweak: Virus GNA disks are now properly tiny items.
  - experiment: '"Cult Balance and Tweaks of the Month! - March"'
  - rscadd: Shades now make noise when they attack and when they die. Cultist also
      make some noise when they turn into a shade.
  - tweak: '"Rapid Tracing is now a tier 3 tattoo (thus available at Act 3 once more).
      Speed bonus upped from 60% to 66% (1 less tick per word basically)"'
  - rscadd: Arcane Knowledge rune is now Arcane Dimension, and tier 2. Lets you store
      an Arcane Tome into an invisible dimensional pocket and pick it up whenever.

      same duration as the mute)"'
  - rscadd: Using a stun talisman on someone makes a visual indicator appear, visible
      only to cultists, that lets you estimate the time until the stun runs out. The
      indicator disappears once the stun is over, or the victim dead.
  - tweak: Arcane Tomes now open and close themselves when using them to write a rune,
      or picking a talisman using the radial menu. This does NOT bring up the pop-up.
  - tweak: '"Only dead cultists are now prompted to enter a Soul Blade planted upon
      an altar, and each cultist can only do it once per game. So make it count! (cultists
      can technically still get back afterwards thanks to the Resurrect rune)"'
  - rscadd: Juggernauts and Wraiths may now join Artificers as part of the Constructs
      Dance Club.

      that they can soulstone the people they sacrifice by using an empty soul blade.

      two tiles.
  - rscadd: Several changes have been made to the neo-soviet funk boots!
  - rscadd: Having your name "Putin" will make you more russian than a normal russian
      name. No celebrities were harmed, and is clearly inspired by a music video.
  - rscadd: Drinking vodka will make you count russian for as long as it's in you.
      It has to be the real deal vodka ala tunguska triple distilled, not derivatives
      or knock-offs!
  - tweak: The more russian you are, the bigger the explosion when it inevitably decides
      to blow up instead of reducing the explosion!
2019-03-05:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that let a crew-member that refused conversion be designed
      as sacrifice target the instant before they get devoured.
  - tweak: Removed the cooldown on sacrifice target re-roll, instead, any cultist
      may now force a re-roll at an altar by communing with Nar-Sie if the target
      either had their body destroyed, or fled the station's Z level. This means that
      the cult may now confirm that their target is still around the station.
  - tweak: Added a bunch of flavor text when progressing to Act 1 or getting converted
      to remind cultists how to summon their own Arcane Tome.
  - tweak: Added a bunch of flavor text when a conversion failed so cultists understand
      the coffer's purpose.

      page.

      magic wand like a wizard staff or null rod to make a rabbit appear.
  - rscadd: Added rabbits. They don't do or say much other than look cute.
  Exxion:
  - bugfix: Fixed two ancient bugs that caused fires to burn hotter and release more
      CO2 than intended. Fires in general are now much colder and produce much, much
      less pressure. This affects bombs as well. Since six years of balance happened
      since these bugs were introduced, some numbers are probably going to have to
      be tweaked.
  SirSkeleto:
  - rscadd: Harm attacking a cablecuffed spaceman will NO LONGER break the cablecuffs,
      and instead stab the target.
  boy2mantwicethefam:

  - rscadd: Adds an optional locking module for spacepods.
  ShiftyRail:
  - tweak: '"Added the *High Threat* setting to the HuD list. It is meant to be used
      against foes that are armed and against which you should _really_ tase first,
      and ask questions later. Sprites courtesy of @otatoh."'
2019-03-09:
  Exxion:
  - tweak: Almost doubled energy released per mole of reactant in fires, again. This
      should bring bombs and burn chambers back to roughly where they were before,
      or only slightly lower. This also affects all other fires, but any time the
      ratio of reactants to total gas is low, they'll still be far weaker than before.
      (If you see this message but don't observe the effects in-game, blame whoever
      merged the PR)
  Irradiation:
  - tweak: Malfunctioning AIs can now occur dynamically midround with incredibly low
      odds. Dead/Low Lowpop can't roll midround MALF.
  MadmanMartian:
  - tweak: Destroying all the blob cores no longer ends the round entirely. Instead,
      it removes the lockdown upon death.
  - bugfix: Blob infestation, upon reaching a certain point, now blocks the shuttle
      from being called.

  - rscadd: Jury-rigged explosive beartraps now have an overlay
  Zth--:
  - rscadd: Tractors and carts added to cargo.
  otatoh:
  - bugfix: Fixes an inconsistency where you could only set medical records to \*SSD*
      from a medihud, and not a records console.
2019-03-10:
  bathosbathtime:
  - rscadd: Permagunk is now enabled.  Garbage and cleanable messes will now last
      up to five rounds.
  - rscadd: Any round ending antag that destroys the station, like nuke ops or cult,
      will cause the next round on that map to be shiny and clean.
  - rscadd: Janitors get one extra cleaning grenade in each janitor closet (room)
      per 100 gunk tiles from the previous round
2019-03-11:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Roundstart ruleset weights have been adjusted. Overall there will be more
      traitors, less nuke ops and malf.
  - tweak: High danger (potentially round ending) roles have had their ruleset costs
      increased, which lowers the chance of them happening at the same time.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused two roundstart rulesets to proc at population
      levels that should never allow it.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixes the Sith bundle Sith Lightning appearing in the wizard's spellbook
      instead of the normal Lightning. Sith Lightning is weaker than normal Lightning
      (deals half damage).

      in the meantime.

  - tweak: The character preference window will now tell you what color your skin
      tone is instead of just a numerical value
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: The Crazed Weeaboo has been replaced with a Space Ninja. This is fluff
      only.
  - tweak: The hologram projector/dakimakura now has better shadowstep logic.
  - tweak: You can no longer pull a hologram/daki (but you can still destroy it!)
  MadmanMartian:
  - rscadd: Whenever a human speaks, they'll make a small noise of indeterminable
      speech.
  - rscadd: Greys are now properly immune to sulphuric and polyacid
  - rscadd: Adds descriptions to the symptoms of viruses. These are viewable through
      analysis of the virus.
  - rscadd: Recent excavations of the asteroid have yielded findings of an advanced
      civilization. Xenoarchs are recommended to look for parts that are compatible
      with current machinery.
  ShiftyRail:
  - tweak: Using a communicate rune mid-cast will allow you to write a "Cult reminder",
      which will be engraved in the memory of all present cultists and all new converts.
  - tweak: Bloodcult now requires security members to start.
2019-03-15:
  PJB3005:
  - bugfix: Reminded genetics code that ARRAYS START AT ONE. As a result, unstable
      mutagen will now actually randomize SE blocks properly.
2019-03-16:
  MadmanMartian:
  - bugfix: In the event of the crew successfully defeating a blob infestation, the
      lockdown will ACTUALLY be lifted.
  - bugfix: Fixes some worn items not appearing on some species. Now it will use the
      normal human sprites, so there will be irregularities, but it beats the icon
      not showing at all.
  - tweak: The method of repairing a broken vending machine has been made more obvious.
  eplgr:
  - tweak: Body bags now take time to open and close when there's someone inside standing
      up
  - rscadd: Added a new sprite for body bags with someone inside standing up
2019-03-17:
  GeneralVeers25:
  - rscadd: Deff Permabrig now has a chicken for eggs.
  - tweak: The Tomb of Azalin no longer contains a Veil Render. It has been replaced
      with another eldritch artifact.
  - tweak: Boxstation's Brig no longer has a strange bottleneck leading to Perma
  - bugfix: Roidstation, Box, and Deff now have some more firelocks, and some missing/odd
      tiles were corrected.

  - rscadd: A new mode, Civil War of Casters. Whoever wins, we lose!
  - tweak: Midround Ragin' Mages will no longer be discounted if Wizard fired at roundstart.

      arrivals shuttle if there was an earlier wizard.
  - bugfix: Midround From Ghost rules will no longer fail because of picking someone
      who is dead but not ghosted.
  - rscadd: The game will no longer end by killing an antagonist, but if that antagonist

  - tweak: Players can once again select blob looks.
  - rscadd: For roundstart blob only, Clowns may select Clownscape, Chaplains may
      select Skellington, and Engineering staff may select AME.
  - rscadd: Ninja gloves now drain anything with a cell (incl tasers, eguns, cyborgs,
      mechas). If they are on cooldown or the target has less than 100 charge, you
      will interact with the target normally. Feel free to headpat that unpowered
      borg.
  - rscadd: Wearing ninja gloves renders you untrackable by an AI.
  - tweak: The ninja katana no longer conducts electricity.
  - tweak: You may now slice through cables on the ground with any sharpness >=1 item.

      50 times

      spam the station.
2019-03-21:
  SonixApache:
  - tweak: E20s are now once again locked to the librarian's uplink.
2019-03-22:
  Kurfursten:
  - rscdel: Removed an RNG check that made latejoin traitors and ninjas less common.
  - tweak: Revs will no longer win if Heads flee on the emergency shuttle or pods,
      though they can still secure victory by killing the heads before the shuttle
      lands.
  - tweak: Rev objectives are now more clear that you can exile heads instead of killing
      them.
  - bugfix: Summon guns once again gives guns to all
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug in which the Donutgiver could only be swapped on
  - rscadd: The station is now more multi-chaplain friendly. The game notes all active
      religions instead of just the last chaplain to join, and the library can print
      texts for all of them.
  - rscadd: When joining as chaplain, you will be prompted as to whether you'd like
      the traditional book design and deity of your religion. If the answer is yes
      you will skip the customization parts. (Polytheists are prompted to choose a
      patron deity)

  - rscadd: Prayers are now better at predicting which deity should reply to your
      prayers.

  - bugfix: Fixes being able to exploit degenerative calcium by using robotic limbs
  - tweak: Renamed Ice peppers to Chilly peppers, as requested

      faster.
  SonixApache:
  - tweak: The fighting grounds for the Civil War of Casters are creeping ever closer

2019-03-23:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Decades of roaming maintenance tunnels and interacting with its denizens
      have granted janitors the ability to understand the speech of mice and rats.
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: A bunch of broken religion keys, like science, now work
  - rscadd: Objectives can now exist as a delayed type where the target is chosen
      later. Assassinate is delayed 10 minutes for most antags (but not for revolutionaries).
      This means that latejoining within the first 10 minutes is functionally equal
      to being ready at start for roundstart assassinations.
  MadmanMartian:
  - rscadd: Default alternate job option is now return to lobby, rather than get random
      job.
  - bugfix: Fixes preferences breaking
  SonixApache:

  - rscadd: robotic limbs now have a 15 damage threshold, burn and brute combined,
      before they are considered malfunctioning
2019-03-24:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: As our player numbers have soared in the past week, Dynamic Mode which
      had been designed to support populations oscillating between 5 and 50 players
      has basically kept picking mode as if we were being permanently at Threat Level
      100, as far as roundstart rulesets are concerned at least. Therefore a new alternative
      configuration has been put in place that puts more weight on the Threat Level,
      and less on the player population, with the goal to bring back some variety
      to our rounds, and less Nuke+Malf+Blob at every or so roundstarts.
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: Loose catbeast antagonists are now black cats.
  MadmanMartian:
  - bugfix: The ghetto space helmets icon states now work
2019-03-26:
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: Soul ramblers have been spotted in Nanotrasen space. Beware their weapons-grade
      philosophical insights.

      docks, or if it was already docked/traveling to centcom when it was given to
      you.

      no longer leave action buttons on your screen after being dropped or stored
      away.

  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Cultists now have reminders in their notes for the first three runes (Raise
      Structure, Communication, Summon Tome).
  - rscadd: Trying to use a rune before the Act allows it will now also remind cultists
      of their current objective.
  - rscadd: The cup found in cult coffers is now called a tempting goblet. It will
      always refill the blood vessels of cultists drinking blood from it, regardless
      of blood type.
  - rscadd: Non-cultists drinking blood from it however will always get toxins instead,
      as well as suffering from hallucination, red view, jittering, dizziness, and
      a short version of the Confusion rune's effects as well.
  - rscadd: Throwing the goblet will splatter its content on the floor, but if someone
      gets hit by it and their mouth isn't covered, they'll take a gulp first.
  - rscadd: the Raise Structure rune now uses a Radial menu specifying that the Spire
      and Forge are unlocked at Act 1 and 2 respectively.
  - rscadd: Added an admin debug button to easily skip Cult Acts.
  - rscadd: Added some extra info to the cult scoreboard at the end of the round,
      such as the highest count of bloody floors reached.
  - tweak: Asteroid floors, the Vox outpost, vaults or the prison no longer allow
      blood spill progress during Act 3. Sorry Roid cultists.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Shortcut Tracer tattoo HUD icon.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Cult appearing as "successful" on the scoreboard if all its
      current objectives were posthumously completed after the cult had already been
      defeated (such as blood getting spilled after the cult lost)
  SirSkeleto:
  - tweak: charging apcs are yellow now
  SonixApache:

      oxygen tank to go with it.

      when appearing.
  - tweak: You no longer need harm intent to cut walls with weapons that allow you
      to cut walls (currently melee energy weapons) because the feature was too obscure.
      You still need harm intent for cutting airlocks!
  - tweak: 'Antimov lawset now has a capitalized "must". It looks like this: "MUST".'
2019-03-29:
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: Once again fixes the bug where heads would be "exiled" during revs by
      getting inside a mech, locker, sleeper, etc.
  MadmanMartian:
  - rscadd: Blacksmithing quality now matters for force, throwforce, and physical
      armors
  - rscadd: Butchering techniques have been developed so that you can butcher vox
      to yield vox meat. We are not sure why this was developed, but it has been.
  SirSkeleto:
  - rscadd: The nazi. soviet, and boda vending packs are now available from the cargo
      console again.
  - tweak: null rod fucks up vampires once more
  - tweak: also fixes a bug with the old code

  Zth--:
  - rscadd: Brewer, soda dispenser, and booze dispenser circuits can be printed at
      the circuit imprinter.
  - bugfix: Mulebots load and unload on a different system now, fixing a lot of unwanted
      behaviour. Please report any bug that you encounter.
  unid15:
  - tweak: Cockroaches will now partially consume food they lay eggs on, sucking out
      nutrients, and generating toxins and eggs. If the food contains mutagen, the
      cockroach might mutate.
  - tweak: Food with no nutriment (or other cockroach eggs) will no longer be used
      to spawn eggs. 1u of nutriment supports about 2 eggs.
  - tweak: Cockroaches no longer place infinite eggs on trash items. They're now limited
      to 1 egg per turf with trash on it.
2019-03-30:
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: Walking into airlocks while brain-damaged now has a chance to make you
      headbutt it, the same as clicking it.
  - rscadd: Headbutting is now a 'proc'.
2019-03-31:

  DamianX:
  - tweak: Undid a change that let people crawl out of knockdowns. Tabling, window
      smashing, neurotoxin, and more now properly stun their victims. You can still
      crawl if you're knocked down by pain.
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: You can no longer use mannequins to remove undroppable items
  - tweak: Department accounts lowered to 500 (750 for station account)
  - rscdel: Some accounts can be hidden from accounts database (shoal, slot machines,
      vendors). Attempting to set an ID to use these accounts will cause an error,
      as will trying to set a wrong account number.
  - tweak: Lowered the prices of the most expensive things in cargo that were balanced
      around department accounts
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where Cargo was the department attached to public vending
      machines instead of the (unused) vendor account. This means Cargo can't set
      prices or be 100% reimbursed for buying things anymore.

      bank account (mostly trader relevant)
  - tweak: 'Shields and other blocking items (e.g.: katanas) now properly block thrown

      toxic farts, resistance to alcohol, turning into a skeleton, and setting yourself
      on fire) have been properly labeled as superpowers, even if immolate still sets
      you on fire, but at least you can do it intentionally!"'
  - tweak: The melting superpower (the one that turns you into a skeleton) now uses
      a cooldown of 20 seconds instead of 100 charges (that get consumed even when
      it fails because you are a skeleton).
  - tweak: The farsight genetic power is now a toggle ability, in case you didn't
      want your overlays to be ruined indefinitely and the like.
  - spellcheck: Fixed a typo for the description of cryokinesis superpower.
  - spellcheck: Fixed a typo for the telekinesis superpower (not observable in-game).
2019-04-04:

      in atmospherics). This basically gives them parity with volume pumps under optimal
      conditions.
  - tweak: Passive gates now function like one-way check valves, letting gas pass

      E.V.A maintenance access was worked back in between Solars and Ghetto Bar. Most
      of the lights were removed to stay in tune with other maintenances. A lot of
      clutter that got in the way of actually moving down maintenance was moved or
      culled (both this one and others). The ragecage no longer has 20 blockers including
      multiple view occluders inside it. Access to Security Hallway was removed in
      favor of re-adding the window bay
  - tweak: Slight tweak to other maintenances on Boxstation to streamline movement,
      align some doors and generally make it -feel- nice. Also the Auxilliary Cyborg
