2020-11-13:
  Allspice:
  - bugfix: Add the starting runes to roundstart cultists' notes.
  - rscdel: Remove the buggy walk-over animation from the reveal rune.
  Blithering:
  - rscadd: the cargo merch store now stocks swiss army knives.
  DamianX:
  - tweak: 'Synergy: Fixed a bug that prevented brig cell lockers from being locked
      when the timer was activated, added fire extinguishers to the hallway, added
      mesons to maintenance tunnels.'
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Performing surgery with no dexterity (due for example to brain damage,
      or being a monkey with no methylin) gives you a chance to fail akin to being
      clumsy.
  - tweak: Data HUD range now depends on the client's view plus an overhead of 7 tiles,
      instead of a fixed 7 tiles. This overhead gives the HUD icons time to appear
      before the mob comes into view, drastically reducing the situations where you
      have to wait a second or two for it to appear.
  GreatBigFailure:
  - tweak: Butcher code has been butchered and stitched back together. Nothing has
      changed (yet) in terms of gameplay.
  PrimeDSS13:
  - tweak: Invisible people no longer have runechat appear over their head.
  gurfan:
  - tweak: 'Castle Station: Nuclear Operatives are three times more likely than usual
      to assault the station.'
  vtlevev1:
  - rscadd: New packed outpost for compact traders
2020-11-15:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Monkeys, Diona Nymphs, and other primitive carbons are now able to use
      their health as blood when performing cult rituals, without the need to acquire
      a syringe and a beaker. Each unit of blood taken translates to 1 oxy damage,
      which is negligible as long as small amounts are used, but can quickly kill
      you if if the ritual requires a lot of blood at once (such as resurrect).
  - rscadd: Aliens can use their blood as cultists as well by popular request. They
      cannot hold tomes though so writing full runes require a bit of effort. They
      take brute damage instead of oxy when writing runes but it's not like it matters
      since they heal all damage types over time by just standing over weeds.
  - rscadd: As a human cultist, you can now just grab a monkey just like you can grab
      a human to use their blood. Note that dead monkeys don't provide any more blood.
      Yes that means you can give them some Dexalin Plus to keep them as free blood
      dispensers, but then again so could you all this time when using a syringe and
      beaker.
  - tweak: Also monkeys now stop wandering around when grabbed with Grab Intent, just
      like when they're being pulled.
  - tweak: Constructs could already use runes that don't require a blood cost, however
      this limitation has been removed, giving constructs new purpose as a catalyst
      for low-cost rune rituals, as constructs can now pay the blood cost without
      having to actually produce any blood. Does this mean rune-drawing constructs
      down the line? I don't know. Not for now anyway (and not later without some
      limitations, Pale Bodies using stun runes is enough of a source of frustration
      already) We'll see how this goes first.
  - tweak: Shades can also use runes from now on, but only ones that don't have a
      blood cost (unless they find a splatter or bleeding corpse). As a side effect,
      so can Cult Blades, that can now fly through Path Runes.
  PrimeDSS13:
  - tweak: Pods no longer brick when you mess them up!
2020-11-17:

      and it''s got more stuff in it such as an ammolathe, a beepsky and holsters.
      Added a security camera console to the security office.'
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: 'Castle Station: Departments now have their own gun cabinets, each containing
      two tasers and four department specific guns. Service and civilian crewmembers
      start with guns as well.'
  - rscadd: 'Castle Station: Heads now get a stun revolver in their respective lockers.'
  - tweak: 'Castle Station: Updated the bar and the science suit storage units in
      EVA.'

      course)

      not assign you to any job where someone else shares the same job slot. For example,

      medium preferences. If none of your preferences are empty, you will return to

  - tweak: When you build a new turf on unsimulated terrain, it will keep the same
      air mix, preventing ZAS while building.

      fastest - melted snow? take it slow!

      heat. Do it enough and you can seal it completely. Shovel a sealed geyser to
      completely remove it.
  - rscadd: Geysers hit by explosions can get sealed, but unstable geysers could go
      critical and spew out extreme heat. Call a suited atmospheric technician to
      seal it if this happens. Do not be tempted to build a thermoelectric generator
      around the critical geyser.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where geysers wouldn't transfer heat to simulated turfs.

  DeityLink:
  - experiment: New antag role! "Syndicate Challengers". Roughly based on the old
      double-agents game mode. Remember to update your preferences to try it out.
  - rscadd: Challengers are fairly similar to traitors in that they have an uplink,
      some TCs, even code words, however their single objective is to assassinate
      another challenger aboard the station, henceforth there's always at least 2
      of them tasked with killing each others. When there are more than 2 challengers,
      their assassination orders are chained so that the first one hunts the second
      one, the second one hunts the third one, etc, until the last one who hunts the
      first one. Once an assassination has been successfully carried out and reported
      to the Syndicate, you take on your victim's target (unless it was you in which
      case no more objectives are given) and receive 5 additional TCs.
  - rscadd: For a successful assassination to be permanently secured by the Syndicate,
      you must take a photo of your victim's dead (crit is enough) body, severed head,
      or brain, and publish it on any newscaster channel for all the crew to see their
      dead body. You can use any channel, but you may want to use your victim's ID
      to create one so as to keep the crew guessing as to your identity, or send the
      message with another stolen ID to send security on a red herring.
  - experiment: This variant on traitor puts the emphasis on robustness and direct
      confrontation between traitors, but the Syndicate doesn't care how the deed
      is performed so long as the kill is reported. Once it has, your victim's own
      assassination objective is forever marked as failed even if they get revived
      and their target dies later.
  - experiment: Cult conversions have been reworked! Details below.
  - experiment: The sounds produced by conversion runes can now only be heard by those
      who have a line of sight to the rune.
  - experiment: Automatic boxing now only happens to cult-banned players.
  - experiment: Refusing conversion now restrains you with ghastly bindings that hinders
      your movements through pain. It takes 1 minute to resist out of those.
  - experiment: Loyalty Implants no longer slow down conversions, but instead force-refuse
      them.
  - rscdel: Setting your cult preferences to Never no longer auto-refuses conversions
      (you now always get the choice) but still displays your preferences as such
      to Seer users.
  - rscadd: Non-cultists restrained by ghastly bindings show up on the altar's cult
      roster, and are valid Blood Magnetism targets (for both summoning and rejoining)
  - rscadd: The pain induced by ghastly bindings fades over time, but gets reset when
      their victim travels through the veil (Path or Blood Magnetism runes)
  - rscadd: The cultist who performed the conversion that restrained someone will
      instantly be informed should the bindings get removed. The bindings also remove
      themselves should another conversion attempt succeed.
  - tweak: Cultists no longer resist Loyalty Implanters, instead the implant pops
      out 10 seconds later.
  - tweak: All loyalty implanted cultists also get informed that they have 10 seconds
      before their implant pops out when Act 2 begins.
  - rscadd: Added holy implants. Can be ordered at cargo. Implanted cultists become
      unable to perform any ritual or use any cult spells. They also become unable
      to travel through the veil (Path Runes or Blood Magnetism) or be affected by
      Fervor. However they are destroyed upon conversion so they cannot be used preemptively
      unlike loyalty implants.
  - tweak: Cultists with holy water in their body will also suffer from those impediments.
  - experiment: Cult deconversions are a thing once again 2 years and a half later.
      They work as such, first have the cultist (or suspected cultist) take a sip
      of holy water (splashing them from the flask also works, or giving them a holy
      wafer to eat, etc). Immediately after slap them with a bible on help intent
      (the target needs to have over 20hp or it won't work). Everyone can do it, not
      just chaplains. If the target wasn't a cultist, nothing unusual happens. Otherwise
      they will be knockdown and given the choice to abandon the cult or resist. In
      both cases after 10 seconds, they take 10 brute damage, and a pair of red shades
      appear. If they accepted the deconversion, those shades will immediately start
      attacking them, otherwise if they resisted the shades will attack the one who
      attempted the deconversion, and other nearby non-cultists.
  - experiment: If a chaplain performed the deconversion with a bible of their religion,
      those red shades have 20hp and deal 5 damage, making them about as much of an
      inconvenience as blob spores. Otherwise they will be as strong as regular shades.
  - rscadd: Bibles, Holy Water, Incense, and Thuribles are now available from Cargo
      as Religious Paraphernelia under Supplies.
  - tweak: Cult mobs spawned by bloodstones no longer stand still for a while before
      attacking non-cultists, they instead immediately give chase once they spawn.
  - tweak: Blood Communion tattoo now also gives a small buff to blood regen.
  - bugfix: Fixed Confusion runes sometimes causing people to remain blinded forever
      when they time-out.
  - bugfix: Fixed deculted players still having cult UI elements on their screen
  - bugfix: Fixed splashing mobs with a holy water flask applying the equivalent of
      half the flask's current volume to them instead of only the 5u being spent.
  - bugfix: Fixed the holy water flask having wrong in-hand sprites when facing some
      directions.
  - bugfix: Using a soulstone on a cultist shade as a non-cultist now properly decults
      the shade.
  - rscadd: De-culted players now get a message specifying exactly what they remember
      about the cult, generally only the player who converted them.
  - rscadd: Cultists can now use altars as operating tables with the same efficiency
      as if they were using an actual operating table. Furthermore, Blood Daggers
      can now be used as ghetto scalpels and circular saws, and Talismans can be used
      as ghetto hemostats.
  HarseTheef:
  - rscadd: Adds the changeling vial, stone mask, and the cult pamphlet to the traitor
      uplink for traitors that want to work together.
  - tweak: Cyborg examine text upon death is more useful
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: The science department has developed a new weather control device to deploy
      on Snaxi.
  - rscadd: Fatsos can now wear the default wintercoat, as well as the security and
      warden versions.
  - bugfix: Hard rock walls on Snaxi are now less pointy
  - tweak: Snaxi brig has been overhauled. It's less chokepointy.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where random bloodstones could sometimes spawn off station
      randomly as long as it was still on Z-1 (for example, in the caves on Snaxi
      or in the Vox outpost on Roid)
  - rscadd: There are now vaults to discover on the Snaxi outer reaches.
  - rscdel: Converted the old Santa cabin and construction site on Snaxi into random
      vaults.
  - tweak: Wolves won't lose nutrition until tamed, and tamed wolves will lose nutrition
      much slower.
  - rscadd: Feral wolves will always attack, whereas pliable wolves are much easier
      to tame.
  PlausibleDeniability:
  - rscadd: The HoS has a new outfit in their closet
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: Banana peels are now more slippery, meaning you can slide a few tiles forward
      if you walk into one.
  - tweak: Cultists now unlock the Forge at Act 1. Additionally, they may now use
      spells which were previously limited to Act 2 and 3.
  gurfan:
  - tweak: Box northern maintenance has been tweaked and slimmed down slightly.
  - tweak: Changelings will gain their victims' memories when absorbing people
2021-01-21:
  Dacendeth:
  - bugfix: Barrels now do the same damage as most other structures when thrown.
  Irradiation:
  - rscadd: You (and mobs) can now break barrels.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - rscadd: Banana peels now slip you further based on potency
2021-01-24:
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: The tradervend now has access to several lootboxes, sponsored by EA. It's
      in the game.
2021-01-25:
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: Barrels no longer have a delay transferring reagents
2021-01-26:
  Allspice:
  - tweak: Traitor cleaver knockdown-on-throw chance 85% -> 100%
  Armadingus:
  - bugfix: Some specific uniforms now show the correct sprite for greys, insectoids
      and vox
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Challengers reporting a kill now absorb their target's remaining TCs into
      their uplink.
  Irradiation:
  - rscadd: Added a bandolier & tile painter to the bartender's locker in Packed Station.
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - tweak: Minor changes and fixes to box Tcomms, podbay, virology, brig, and disposal
      pipes.
2021-01-27:
  beesil:
  - rscadd: Adds more variety to the wonderful wardrobe.
2021-01-28:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed shades in Soul or Chaos Blades taking damage while over space.
  - rscadd: Holy Implants now show up as a yellow blinking dot on sec-huds.
  - rscadd: Confusion runes/talismans now disable all forms of data huds for their
      durations.
2021-01-29:
  BomberBro:
  - rscadd: Race car beds (and more) are now able to be made with 2 sheets of plasteel
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Added a clown language.
  HarseTheef:
  - rscadd: Adds the codebreaker to the 'cooperative cell' tab of the traitor uplink
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: On Snaxi, everyone spawns with a Snow Survival Guide (which links to the
      wiki page) in their backpack. The guide also reacts with snow to flash-ignite
      for a quick boost of heat.
2021-01-30:
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: Syndicate agents now have a tesla cannon available in their uplink.
2021-01-31:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Soulstone Shards can now be used to perform surgery as efficiently as
      glass shards.
  - bugfix: Fixed lasers bouncing off mobs when they should instead miss them (and
      the chat message properly appears once again)
  - bugfix: Fixed lasers no longer going through portals.
  - bugfix: Nuke Ops rejoice! Fixed clicking directly on a portal or teleporter hub
      with a ranged weapon causing the projectile to hit the portal instead of properly
      going through it. This should finally spell an end to nuke ops accidentally
      blowing themselves up trying to fire their RPG through their teleporter.
  - bugfix: Fixed an oversight that let cyborgs spawn as Syndicate Challengers.
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: When you build a snowman, it's just an inanimate structure (clearable with
      a single shovel). If you can give it a carrot nose and a magical hat, however,
      it will spring to life and give you gifts (gifts only first time that hat is
      used).
  ShiftyRail:
  - rscadd: Added tag mode! Changeling clown in a station of Mimes! More info on the
      wiki!
  SonixApache:
  - imageadd: Improved CMC damage number color contrast.
2021-02-01:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: The Gravity artifact effect now has a one second cooldown if activated
      through touch to prevent server-crashing infinite loops. Also this has technically
      been a feature since 2016, interesting it took this long to cause a crash.
  - tweak: When using a bible on someone with holy water in them, you and your target
      now have to stay still for 5 seconds before the ritual proceeds. Cultists get
      a big message in red warning them that someone is trying to deconvert them.
  - tweak: Non-chaplains performing deconversion will only knockdown cultists for
      half the duration.
  - tweak: Cultists with the Unholy Protection tattoo will be immune to the knockdown
      altogether.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Capitalised the first letter on "Ectoplasm" and "Diabeetusol" so they
      match the naming scheme (first letter uppercase)
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - rscadd: 'Roid: Added a substation next to the zoo and a few more AME parts so
      the station gets over the bump of power issues at roundstart.'
  Kromkar:
  - rscadd: Tweaks Black Site Prism; minor mapping changes, rebalances loot and adds
      Syndicate Exec mob. Changes Commandant Chuck Sneed to Buck Reed.
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: A few map fixes on Snaxi and its vaults.
  - bugfix: Capybaras have fixed movement.
  MintyEtude:
  - imageadd: Nanotrasen has spent an inordinate amount of money on new ore processing
      console screensavers so that the mining department can't file any abandonment
      complaints.
  SonixApache:
  - rscadd: Implanters and implant cases now tell you what implant is loaded in them
      upon examination.
  - rscadd: Implants now work properly when surgically implanted into people.
  - rscadd: Surgically removed implants can be put back into implant cases to make
      them implanter-compatible again.
  - rscdel: (syndicate) Implants now have a (high) chance to fizzle out upon removal.
  - bugfix: Implants no longer work when broken.
2021-02-03:
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - bugfix: Roidsubstation now requires engineering access.
  - tweak: Increased the size of packed mechanics office slightly.
  - bugfix: We found the missing SMES for packed Engineering. We predict this will
      reduce new engineers singuloosing on packed by 12:30 by 47.65%. Also changed
      some firelocks and wires to be more intuitive/easier to navigate and repair.
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: The armory is now on the proper power grid on Snaxi
  SonixApache:
  - imageadd: Changed armor vest sprites up a bit. For those who prefer the fat straps,
      use an armor vest on a secvend.
2021-02-04:
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - bugfix: Shame. Missing terminals.
  Sooose:
  - bugfix: Removed the ability to throw anvils with telekinesis.
2021-02-05:
  Exxion:
  - tweak: 'Windows are back to their pre-late-2018 behavior when moved: They maintain
      their direction again when moved instead of turning to face the direction of
      movement.'
  PJB3005:
  - bugfix: deadharvest artifact effect won't randomly break and correctly gets copied
      to artifact batteries.
  - bugfix: Admin rejuvenate no longer bulldozes various mutations like no breathing.
2021-02-06:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: The Pay2Use Large Artifact effect trigger can now only appear in a Primary
      Effect, never a Secondary Effect (because paying money is annoying enough that
      you shouldn't on top of that have only a 25% chance for it to activate the effect)
  - tweak: Large Artifacts featuring a Pay2Use primary effect trigger can now be summarily
      examined to see if they appear to feature a coin slot, bill acceptor, or card
      reader, since the Anomaly Analysis will otherwise give you the same results
      as a Touch or Reagent trigger, and such features should be noticeable to the
      naked eye anyway.
2021-02-07:
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Mimes now also know the Clown language, as per that whole "Clown-Mime
      War" thing.
  - tweak: 'Changed the Clown Language''s colour from #FBFF35 (Bright yellow) to #FF9FEF
      (Light Pink).'
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - tweak: Advanced Camera Consoles on all maps have been changed for regular Camera
      Consoles, with a board left behind in the warden's locker as an afterthought
      by the repo-man who downgraded them.
  Kharkov72:
  - imageadd: new bar sign, the hungry bug.
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: The shrunken vampire head can now be used inhand once per minute to screech
      and break glass within 1 tile. Unlike a real screech, this does not stun anyone.
  - tweak: The shrunken vampire head flash now pierces eye protection like vampire
      glare. It also has 7 force instead of 0.
  - tweak: The depocket wand is now small enough to fit in pockets.
  - tweak: The energy shotgun now indicates how to toggle its fire mode when examined
      (alt-click).
  - tweak: The autocuffer can now be used on orange shoes.
  - tweak: 'Removing cuffs from shoes now executes their removal effect (e.g.: explodes
      syndicuffs, deletes borg cuffs)'
  - rscadd: Traders are now selling a ricochet taser.
  PJB3005:
  - tweak: Xenoarch triangulation has no more maximum distance to find artifacts.
      Alden-Saraspovas still do like before. The idea here is that triangulation can
      now be used as a late-game tool if you're having trouble locating further artifacts
      with Saraspovas.
  - rscadd: Admin rejuvenate now re-attaches butts.
  - tweak: Vox and plasmamen can now safely use the xenoarchaeology essence printer.
  PrimeDSS13:
  - tweak: roomba stab cooldown is now five seconds as opposed to ten
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - rscadd: Added a new medical robot board that upgrades its surgery tools.
2021-02-08:
  MintyEtude:
  - imageadd: Some old bar signs [Saucy Clown, Clown's Head, The Damn Wall, Limbo]
      have been refurbished with shiny new neon tubing. Take a look around your local
      establishment next time the rest of the crew gets stone drunk off whiskey and
      starts blasting ancient showtunes throughout the station.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where you could literally not build cyborgs on Castlestation.
      Yes, this is a bug, this is not a feature, this is an unintended gameplay element
      that has been unfortunately cut out of the final product. You may now jeer as
      the only thing that kept security cyborgs on Castle at bay(station) was this
      bug, which is now gone, and now so is the fun.
2021-02-10:
  Kharkov72:
  - tweak: Janitors can use the door to disposals from the cargo lobby now.
  - bugfix: Amish suits on the floor should exist again.
  jellyveggie2:
  - tweak: You can now examine jukeboxes and sound systems to learn the name of the
      current song.
2021-02-11:
  Allspice:
  - tweak: Let wraiths use their jaunt spell by pressing the "use inhand item" button.
  beesil:
  - tweak: Changes threshold for flavor text to show a "more" button from 32 characters
      -> 64 characters.
2021-02-12:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Empty Soul Gems can now be fitted into a Construct Shell, turning it into
      a Shade Beacon. Roaming shades can use the beacon to become a construct without
      the need for another player to slot them inside the shell, allowing cultists
      to prepare those in preparation of a fight (because once Act 3 hits no cultist
      has time to make you a soul gem or a shell, let alone deal with you).
  - rscadd: Artificers can now slot Soul Gems (empty or full) in a construct shell
      if both are adjacent to them, by just clicking on the shell. You can also click
      the beacon to get the empty gem back.
  - tweak: Artificer health buffed from 50hp to 100hp. They're now a bit more sturdy
      than Wraiths (that only have 75hp) but still far from Juggernauts (250hp). This
      should help them survive more than two seconds once their base is getting broken
      into, they still suck in direct combat though.
  - rscdel: Wraiths can no longer fire bolts that nail mobs down in place.
  - rscadd: This nailing ability has been moved to thrown blood daggers.
  - rscadd: Wraith Phase Shift cooldown from 17 seconds to 15 seconds.
  - rscadd: Wraiths have a new Wraith Tear spell (with 7.5 seconds cooldown) that
      essentially gives them warping claws ability. Just like with warping claws you
      can channel the ability by toggling throw mode. The portals created by Wraith
      Tear only last 3 seconds and do not connect atmospheres, nor create sparks when
      they close. Non-cultist carbons who pass through them will experience 3 seconds
      of cult confusion, along with dizziness and other misc. effects. Lastly those
      portals leave a blood splatter behind them.
  - rscadd: Wraiths have now learned to write two runes specifically, Path Entrance
      and Path Exit. Each with a 60 seconds cooldown.
  - tweak: Wraiths damage has been nerfed from 25 brute to 15 brute.
  - experiment: The intent is to have Wraith perform more of a support role directly
      on the field, unlike Artificers that generally stay in base or Juggernauts that
      go straight into fights. By having two movement spells Wraiths can more easily
      get out of danger (they have the lowest HP of all constructs now) While the
      ability to write down Path Runes makes them a valuable asset to the cult beyond
      getting rid of a nosy AI.
  - imageadd: Wraiths also have a new Phase Shift animation.
  - bugfix: Fixed thrown blood daggers appearing with an incorrect sprite when created
      using non-red blood.
  Sooose:
  - bugfix: All heads of staff can now fax Nanotrasen HR to demote or commend employees.
  coldud13:
  - bugfix: Snaxi gateway room now accepts either teleporter or gateway access.
2021-02-13:
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: There is now a santa bag type that doesn't spawn infinite gifts.
2021-02-16:
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - tweak: People with morgue access can now no longer use the morgue interior door
      as a shortcut to sneak into medbay.
  - rscdel: Security checkpoint on deff has door into medbay removed to keep in line
      with the new policy.
2021-02-21:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: the Juggernaut construct's shield that protects it from weapons of force
      10 and below now also protects it from similarly weak thrown items, punches,
      and projectiles.
  - tweak: HOWEVER its armor goes away completely when it loses a third of its health
      (and cracks begin to appear, as explained below). The armor comes back when
      the juggernaut is healed past the threshold by an artificer.
  - imageadd: A visual cue and sound appear whenever an attack gets successfully blocked
      by a juggernaut's shield
  - imageadd: Constructs now have luminous cracks visibly appear on their shell as
      they take damage. They have two different cracked states, each reached after
      losing another third of their health. (and of course getting healed by an artificer
      will remove those cracks)
  - imageadd: Slightly improved the ectoplasm sprite, so it looks both better on the
      floor, and is easier to click.
  - imageadd: Ectoplasm spawned from shattered constructs will now be of the same
      color as the eyes of the construct it came from.
  - bugfix: The ghosts of dead constructs or shades no longer appear like grey piles
      of dust.
  toomykins:
  - rscadd: added "get belt" verb
2021-02-22:
  Allspice:
  - tweak: Also let juggers and artis use one of their spells by clicking the "activate
      held object" button.
  Eneocho:
  - rscdel: Removed Solanine from Ambrosia Cruciatus
  - rscdel: Removed Solanine from Amborsia Vulgaris
  - rscdel: Removed Cytisine from Ambrosia Deus
  - rscadd: Added Phytocarisol and Kathalai to Ambrosia Deus
  - rscadd: Added Cytisine to Death Berries.
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: An antimatter containment jar with 10x the normal capacity is now available
      at cargo
  HarseTheef:
  - rscadd: Adds the Sniper/Spotter team bundle to the uplink under the new Elite
      Syndie Bundle option
  ShiftyRail:
  - rscadd: During Blood Cult, one cultist is the chief of the Cult and can talks
      directly to other cultists by using ":x". He gets also a special HuD icon.
2021-03-02:
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: Jukeboxes, transmitters, and uranium tiles/walls/doors now provide power
      to radiation collectors. Jukebox engine patent pending.
2021-03-04:
  Apogee-dev:
  - rscadd: Body scanners can now be emagged to irradiate their occupant.
  - rscadd: Sleepers can now be emagged to disable overdose protection and give fake
      readouts if a patient is being overdosed.
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: New items added to the merch computer. Including a cheap soap guaranteed
      for 20 uses (and then has a progressively increasing chance of melting away),
      and Sterile Masks, that come in the usual medbay variety along with a more sober
      black variant, and a terribly clowny colorful variant.
  - rscadd: Sterile Masks can now be moved away from your face like breath masks can.
      Doing so will null their sterility factor until you put it back on properly.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Lossetta stone now can teach Clownish as well.
  - rscadd: Holy water works the same as water when mixed with potassium.
  - rscadd: Holy water-potassium explosions play a HALLELUJAH sound effect.
  - rscadd: Holy water-Potassium explosions are slightly stronger than regular water-potassium
      explosions.
  N3X15:
  - rscadd: Added a bunch of new words to VOX announcements.
  PavelCIA:
  - rscadd: Adds the "Impostor" character from the 2018 hit video game "Among Us"
  ShiftyRail:
  - tweak: The time limit for the vox raiders heist has been doubled. (From 30 minutes
      to 60 minutes)
  Squird5:
  - rscadd: Rotated the belt in a dumb way that actually worked.
  - rscadd: Rebuilt the Centcom Cargo Dock so the shuttle doesn't have to flip, bugging
      the conveyors. Conveyors now work!
  - rscadd: Swapped out basic lights for HE lights in Botany
  - rscadd: Added QMLoad tags to the associated conveyors
  TurboGay:
  - rscadd: adds the mudslide drink/reagent/sprite
  - rscadd: adds the boysenberry blizzard drink/reagent/sprite
  - rscadd: adds the sacrificial mary drink/reagent/sprite
  - rscadd: adds the creamy hot chocolate drink/reagent/sprite
  ancientpower:
  - tweak: Hyperzine increases internal and external bleeding by roughly 30%
  coldud13:
  - tweak: Be careful about kicking guns around!
  kane-f:
  - bugfix: Ghosts no longer make security alerts screens hide warnings by interacting
      with them.
  - tweak: Priority announcements now make a sound when they appear in chat
  - bugfix: Diona nymphs wearing bags of holding now properly create singularities
      if put inside another bag of holding.
2021-03-06:
  giraffism:
  - rscadd: Adds in wolf headdress, just skin a wolf and you can have your very own
      wolf headdress!
  - rscadd: Wolves now have teeth to be removed
2021-03-09:
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: Castlestation will now prevent you from creating AI and Cyborgs. Unholy
      magics that mess with the fabric of reality are unaffected.
  - tweak: The MK2 medical cyborg upgrade now also doubles the storage capacity for
      brute kits, burn kits and splinters.
2021-03-11:
  Apogee-dev:
  - tweak: Lightswitches are now turned off by default.
  - tweak: Lightswitches check for players at roundstart and turn on if there are
      any present.
  DeityLink:
  - soundadd: Added a Funk playlist to the jukebox, courtesy of Dickwrath.
  - soundadd: Added a brand new Shoegaze playlist to the jukebox. With lots of reverb
      for that big old bar feel.
  - imageadd: Revamped the vinyl sprite. The label in the center is still red by default
      but can be customized for each different playlist.
  - experiment: Player-controlled Giant Spiders now have some sort of color-matrix
      powered night vision that lets them see quite well in the dark while still being
      able to identify lit areas, and therefore to seek lights to destroy. Might refine
      later. Feedback welcome.
  - rscadd: Player-controlled Giant Spiders have a brand new HUD, featuring a health
      indicator, a fire warning, and a zone selection (for choosing which limb to
      target on humans). Spiderlings also have an indicator for their growth, while
      Nurse have indicators for both how many eggs they can lay, and how many spiders
      there are in total, as well as how many are needed before they can evolve into
      a Queen.
  - rscadd: Player-controlled spiderlings are now able to ventcrawl (turns out they
      couldn't until now, despite NPC spiderlings being one of the only mob actually
      having an AI that lets it ventcrawl)
  - rscadd: Player-controlled Giant Spiders now have spells for all their abilities
      that can be cast by players should they end up controlling one. This includes
      Spiderlings growing up (they get to choose whether to become Guard, Nurse or
      Hunter), as well as Nurse spinning webs, cocoons, laying eggs, and evolving
      into queens
  - tweak: Spider hunters are now twice faster, still slower than carps though.
  - rscadd: Changed the requirements and logic behind spider nurses evolving into
      queens. Before nurses would instantly become queens if there were less than
      5 queens in the world. Now there has to be at least 10 spiders total (including
      spiderlings) per queen in the world for an NPC nurse to evolve. It will then
      have a 10% chance per second to evolve. Player-controlled nurses only require
      6 spiders per queen, ensuring that NPC nurses shouldn't cuck players out of
      becoming queens. As a side-effect, non-queen nurses will become more common
      once again.
  - rscadd: Spider queen projectiles no longer deal 5 brute damage, instead they root
      mobs to the floor just like blood nails do. As for those, resisting or clicking
      the webs will let you break out after one or two seconds. The queen can fire
      her projectile about every three or four seconds at best (BYOND time is uncertain).
  - bugfix: Fixed the giant spider queen's projectile being invisible
  - bugfix: Fixed NPC spider nurses laying two egg clusters when they should only
      be able to lay one, causing them to birth twice as many spiderlings as normal.

      of the color of the first-aid kit used to build them, but this time ALL first-aid
      kit variants are supported, as the bot's icon is generated from the kit's icon.
  - tweak: Medibots no longer give different reagent depending on the first-aid kit
      used to build them, instead they now all give the "better" reagent corresponding
      to the damage type instead of tricord.

      and points directly into the machine.
  - rscadd: You can now set a custom output tile for Cryo and Cloners by using a multitool,
      similar to how it works for autolathes and other fabricators. When automatically
      ejecting patients, they will go to the custom tile instead of on top of the
      machine.
  kane-f:
  - tweak: Prisoner management consoles no longer file remote explosive implants under
      their own header

  - bugfix: Fixed the Rocket-Dash mecha spell icon being blank

      precision radius, meaning you could land anywhere in one of the 81 tiles (in
      a 9x9 area) surrounding the tile you clicked, which made it utterly unreliable
      on top of having a long cooldown. Often you'd even teleport right where you
      started from.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: RTGs and PDTGs malfunction if they get EMP'd or Ion'd, possibly losing
      max charge, self-charging speed or both.

  help-maint:
  - rscadd: Added Midazoline, a chemical created with clonexadone, sulfuric acid,
      and gold powder, mixed in a jar that also contains 1 solid bar of plasma. Midazoline
      converts ALL chemicals it touches into more Midazoline. The exception is Mercury,
      which turns Midazoline into more Mercury.
  kane-f:

      at all costs!

      recipe (20u Diamond, 20u Silicate and 10u Frost Oil)
  - rscadd: You can mutate plain old carrots into diamond carrots, which have a bit
      of diamond dust inside (the same amount as a golden apple would have gold).

  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed shades missing their Cult HUD when re-login into the game.
  - bugfix: Fixed Pipe Caps not properly connecting to pipes or being of the wrong
      color when painted. Not that they actually do anything beyond being cosmetic.
  - rscadd: Added Heat Exchanger Pipe Caps. Still cosmetic, still useless, those connect
      to Heat Exchanger Pipes. Use them if you want your pipes to look neat I guess.
  - imageadd: Fixed a few pipe sprites, namely Heat Exchanger Junctions have a new
      sprite as an item.
  - tweak: Re-arranged some of Boxstation's TEG setup. Removed some useless and redundant
      connectors, and swapped the CO2 canisters with some of the Plasma canisters
      from Engineering storage, so newbies don't get under the impression that CO2
      is meant to be the better choice for those gas loops. (A long time ago those
      were there to help stop fires that'd come out from the burn chamber but CO2
