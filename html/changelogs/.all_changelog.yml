      (between 3 and 6 minutes) but the cloning time and biomass use can be reduced

      turns user into a hulk.  Unlike a hulk, however, Horrors can punch people so
      hard they have a 25% chance of flying down a hallway.  Can also force open doors
      (50% chance after 5 sec).  Throwing speed bonus.  Takes twice as much fire damage
      as a normal human.  <u>YOU CANNOT RETURN TO HUMAN FORM AFTER CHANGING INTO A
      HORROR.</u>

  Angelite Entyshak:
  - bugfix: Certain mobs can no longer be forced to walk indefinately by targeting
      guns with allowing hostages to walk. (I probably fucked up wording this.)
  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Fixing areas with colored lights showing all white on pictures.
  - bugfix: Fixed many objects and some turfs not appearing at all on pictures (all
      the doors, the kitchen's floor, etc...)
  - bugfix: Fixed many objects not appearing on pictures if they have been pulled
      in certain directions.
  - tweak: Mobs will now always appear to face south on pictures. A necessary evil
      related to human species and limbs. humanoids would always face south while
      their clothes would face their actual direction, causing an ugly dissonance.
      If someone can make humans face their actual direction on pictures and not just
      their clothes, please do. I am unable to.
  - bugfix: Mobs that are lying on the ground now appear as such pictures.

      rune (Because sending 3 cultists into crit to summon one sounds a bit wonky
      to me, take_overall_damage ain't no joke).
  - imageadd: Added animations for the Summon Cultist rune. (and people near the cultist
      before he gets summoned get a message)

      to be rabid according to the half-implemented rabid code)

      with water.
  - rscadd: Showers now actually wet the floor as well. No running!

  - rscadd: SEEDS AND PLANTS<br>Seed/plant/product data is stored in a set of global
      seed datums.<br>These datums can diverge to form new species and be manipulated

      of hydroponics trays.<br>Mutant species varieties are now handled in a modular
      way.<br>Plants now have ideal heat, light and pressure values, as well as tolerances
      for differences.<br>Plants can produce multiple different kinds of product.<br>Reagent

      plants and vines are both possible.<br>
  - rscadd: SPACE VINES<br>Space vines are now plantsegments pathwise in view of future
      intentions to make them more general.<br>Spawned event kudzu should be identical
      to the current master implementation as it has no seed datum and ignores all
      the new code.<br>Space vines now make use of seed data if spawned with a reference
      and can be harvested from.<br>Vines now cause physical damage if they are carnivorous,
      and inject reagents if their seed data includes them.<br>Vines will die if they
      find themselves in area outside of their tolerance.
