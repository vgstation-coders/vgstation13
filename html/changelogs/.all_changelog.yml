      once to populate it.

      target empty apiaries in priority, but if they can't find any, they'll build
      their own from scratch! Each species has their own wild hive.
  - rscadd: Wild hives work like normal ones, except that you cannot add queen bee
      packets or beezeez, or empty bees into them.
  - rscadd: Added Hornets. They have a chance to spawn from infestation events, and
      traitor botanists may purchase Hornet Queen Packets for 2 TC each. Hornets have
      a chance to deal partial damage through protection, so handle carefully!

      and Bagel.'

      prisoners, and privacy in the form of Smartglasses that can be toggled on or
      off.'
  - rscadd: 'Deff: Security checkpoint in medbay can be accessed via medical lobby,
      and now has a security cameras computer.'
  - rscadd: 'Deff: Perma is more secured, with a layer of grille + plasma window on
      top of the renforced wall outside. This means you can no longer sneak in with
      a false wall unnoticed.'
  - rscadd: 'Deff: Added a security locker to the arrivals checkpoint.'
  - rscadd: 'Deff: Added a second sec vend.'
  - rscadd: 'Deff: Security has access to the internal morgue airlock, like in Box

  - bugfix: Made sure that nuked hives won't spawn more bees.
  - tweak: Newly placed apiary trays can only be colonized by either homeless queens
      or queen packets for the first 20 seconds of their existence. So if you place
      a hive after deconstructing an apiary, you know it won't get stolen by a queen
      from another apiary.
  - tweak: Homeless queens have to be in the wandering state for 20 seconds before
      they become able to build a wild hive. Which should prevent them from starting
      building them before you've had the time to place the apiary trays back down.
  - tweak: Queen-less homeless bee swarms now begin to lose health after 5 minutes,
      down from 10 minutes.
