  Irradiation:
  - rscadd: 'Synergy: Added a missing stamp to the Chief Engineer''s office and to
      the Judge''s desk in the courtroom.'
  - rscdel: 'Synergy: Removed a redundant keycard authenticator that was on the floor
      in the Chief Engineer''s office.'

2023-10-29:
  CrazyAmphibian:
  - rscadd: The spacesuit modification station will now say why a module was not installed.
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: "Solar Panels no longer sometimes do an almost complete rotation when\
      \ their target orientation requires them to pass through the 0\xB0|360\xB0 mark."
  - imageadd: Solar Panels are no longer visually constrained to 8 directions, and
      can be observed rotating in real time.
  - rscadd: Solar Panels can now generate powers even if they aren't connected to
      a Solar Panel Control computer.
  - rscadd: Players can now use a wrench on Solar Panels to change their rotation
      manually. Rotating them this way is faster than doing it from a computer, but
      you need to remain adjacent until the rotation is over or it will be incomplete.
  - rscadd: Solar Panels are now affected by EMPs, which cause them to spin to a random
      orientation. They will re-calibrate themselves on their own as long as they
      are connected to a working Solar Panel Control computer.
  - imageadd: Solar Panels now feature visual cracks when they've taken some damage,
      but not enough to break them. Since damage reduces their power output, this
      lets you identify at a glance which panels need repairs.
  - rscadd: Attacking a Solar Panel with a weapon now gives visual and textual feedback
  - rscadd: Simple Animals and Aliens can now attack solar panels.
  - rscadd: Added proper descriptions to both Solar Panels and Solar Trackers.
  - rscadd: Solar Panels can now be distinguished through darkness, and their panel
      becomes fully lit when in direct view of the star.
  - imageadd: The color of Solar Panels now brightens slightly the better aligned
      with the star it is, producing a visible glow at near-perfect alignment.
  - bugfix: Fixed Solar Panels not emitting any power in some cases despite them being
      nearly aligned with the sun.
  - tweak: Solar Trackers now actually need line of sight to the star to provide its
      angle. Despite them iconically being mapped at the extremity of solar arrays,
      you could just build them inside the station.
  - imageadd: Solar Trackers now have a broken sprite. While broken, they cannot be
      used by Solar Panel Control computers to automatically track the star. They
      also now more clearly indicate the current star's rotation as long as they have
      sight of it, while a solar tracker without view of a star will appear noticeable
      darker.
  - tweak: Catwalks have had their cost reduced from 3 metal rods to just 2 (both
      including the 1 rod lattice cost). Their construction time has also been halved.
  - tweak: You no longer have a chance to slip when walking on catwalks.
  - bugfix: Fixed an edge case where placing cables in space didn't check for proper
      support.
  - rscadd: Player-controlled mice now visibly rest.
  - rscadd: The Rapid Cable Layer (RCL) has been rewritten from scratch and is now
      much easier to use and less prone to accidentally placing unwanted wire knots.
      You can click adjacent tiles directly to create a pair of wires that connects
      both that tile and yours (and that tries to connect to existing nodes on both
      tiles even if you didn't pixel-perfect clicked them). Placing wires this way,
      or clicking the RCL enables its active mode, during which you can lay wires
      by just walking around. Unlike previously the RCL won't attempt to place extra
      nodes on tiles that already have wires connecting from the same direction, but
      you can still force that behaviour when clicking tiles. Clicking the RCL again
      disables it.
  - rscadd: RCL added to YouTool vendors at a premium, and Engi-Vends as part of their
      regular stock.
  - rscadd: Electricians (the Station Engineer alt-job) spawn with their own RCL in
      their backpack, and holding an electrical toolbox.
  - imageadd: Of course the RCL had its sprites revamped and now displays not only
      better how much wire is in it, but also its color.
  - bugfix: Fixed cable coil always appearing red in your character's hands despite
      sprites for other colours existing.
  - rscadd: Actually fuck those sprites, cables are now entirely coloured through
      code, and you can paint coils by dipping them in reagent containers containing
      reagents flagged as pigments (such as paint buckets, but blood and a few others
      work as well). The colour carries over to placed wires and cable cuffs.
  Irradiation:
  - rscadd: 'Metaclub: Added a Bhangmeter to the bridge.'
  - rscadd: 'Metaclub: Added some missing wires to power up some electrified grilles.'
  - tweak: 'Metaclub: Remodeled the Bridge command room to accommodate the Bhangmeter.'
  - tweak: Sleep Toxin now has an overdose amount (30 units) that will deal some toxin
      damage if you go over it.
  - tweak: Sleep Toxin will now start destroying your heart if it's in your system
      for more than 8 minutes.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the target that was initially hit by the wizard's "Lightning"
      spell would randomly cause the Lightning spell to not arc to nearby targets
      and randomly hit the same target twice. The Lightning spell will now properly
      arc to other targets and not have a random chance to instantly put someone into
      critical condition while at it.
  - bugfix: The wizard that casts the 'Lightning" spell will no longer be a valid
      target to be dealt damage to, which was caused by the Lightning spell arcing
      to a target that the wizard was in the way of. However, it will still arc off
      the wizard if it is able to do so.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused Pain Mirror to be able to indefinitely ping-pong
      between different Pain Mirror users, provided that they were not human. This
      was, most notably, possible with the wizard's Arcane Golems.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where detaching a mech's jetpack while the jetpack was active
      would render the mech permanently immobile.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where MMIs and posibrains getting inserted into a mech would
      not update its sprite, making it appear as if it was not occupied until they
      moved.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where MMIs and posibrains getting inserted into a mech would
      not have their spell menu appear until their equipment changed.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where users did not receive any message when failing to insert
      a posibrain into a mech with a DNA-lock active, because the posibrain does not
      have a DNA.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where a mech that had its hydraulic clamp removed could still
      automatically collect ore when digging.
  - spellcheck: Added more descriptive messages for when trying to insert an MMI or
      posibrain into a mech with a DNA-lock active.
  - tweak: Grues will no longer see the red damage overlay as they get more damaged.
  - tweak: Civil War of Casters is slightly more likely to happen.
  - tweak: Grues will now nuzzle other grues instead of hitting them.
  - rscadd: Grues will now become increasingly more effective against armored targets
      the more people they eat. After eating 5 people they will reach the limit of
      reducing damage reduction by 50%, multiplicatively.
  - tweak: Grues are now limited to a maximum of 50 damage per hit.
  - tweak: Grues will gain slightly less damage out of every consumed player, from
      7 to 5.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the vampire's Glare ability worked while blindfolded.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where shapeshifted vampires didn't initially update their
      visible name when shapeshifting with no ID.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where a max-power vampire using the Screech ability would
      get a backlash from every single nearby null rod wearer rather than just one.
      This also means the Screech ability will be properly stopped and blocked rather
      than still affecting everyone in the vicinity.
  - bugfix: Null rods carried by people with ear protection will now properly cause
      a backlash against max-power vampires using the Screech ability instead of doing
      nothing.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the vampire's Screech ability would play its sound for
      every single target. It will now only play once per Screech.
  - tweak: Reduced the amount of jittering caused by the vampire's Screech ability
      from 5 minutes to 40 seconds.
  - tweak: The vampire's Screech ability can be used at any time, rather than only
      when there are living targets nearby.
  - tweak: Failing to Enthrall someone as a vampire will no longer put the ability
      on cooldown.
  - tweak: Failing to Hypnotise someone as a vampire, whether because they are blind
      or for other reasons, will no longer put the ability on cooldown.
  - tweak: Vampire abilities that get backlashed by null rods will now go on cooldown.
      This also fixed a bug where the max-power vampire's Glare ability could be spammed
      non-stop.
  - spellcheck: Fixed a tiny typo regarding the message that a vampire receives when
      a null rod causes a backlash.
  - spellcheck: Fixed a tiny typo regarding the message that a victim of a vampire's
      Screech receives. This also extends to the NPC vampire creature.
  brndd:
  - rscadd: PackedStation now has a pneumatic disposals system.
  - tweak: Dionae are now about 33% faster, making them slightly faster than using
      a wheelchair.

  - bugfix: The paramedic winter coat suit slot now uses the correct list of objects.
  jellyveggie2:
  - rscadd: Adds a ghost costume to the halloween costume crate.
  - rscadd: You may also craft your own ghost costume by cutting up a bed sheet while
      targeting the eyes.
  - tweak: A number of robes now have toggleable hoods, just like winter coats.
  - rscadd: Added a face paint spray can to the Halloween costume crate. Use in hand
      to switch modes. Use paper aiming at your head to clean it off.
  jwhitak:
  - bugfix: Low pop events that weren't supposed to fire will no longer fire.
  - bugfix: Vines, Biomass, and Carp need 7 active players.
  - bugfix: Powercreeper, Meteors (Waves/Showers), and Immovable Rods (Small/Large)
      need 7 active players with at least 1 Engineer.
  toomykins:
  - tweak: boxstation's medbay now has a  light switch
  - tweak: roidstation's HoP OFFICE, HoP personal quarters and the abandoned smithy
      now have a light switch
  - rscadd: boxstation tradefloor now has a double airlock system
  - tweak: boxstation research outposts now has a soldering iron

      and eat them.'
  jwhitak:
  - tweak: Radstorms no longer fire unless there's at least 7 active space mans.
2023-10-31:
  toomykins:

      upon spooking
2023-11-01:
  ValkyrieSkies:
  - tweak: Item attack animations are now enabled by default for new players.
  - tweak: Moved Vox & Plasmaman internal supply crates to the Supplies category
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - rscadd: The wizard's spellbook will now tell you which spell is lost upon transferring
      minds with spells such as Mind Swap.
  - rscadd: The wizard's spellbook will now tell you a spell's range once purchased.
  - rscadd: Many spells in the wizard's spellbook will be more descriptive when their
      attribute buttons (such as cooldown and power) are pressed. Most notably, the
      cooldown button will tell you by how many seconds the cooldown is reduced.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the "Card Trick" spell could be acquired from the spellbook
      bundle's ancient spellbook.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the "Chariot" spell could have its cooldown reduced
      despite being a one-time-use spell that summons a Firebird vehicle.
  - spellcheck: The wizard's spellbook will now display "MAXED!" for a maxed spell
      level rather than the upgrade cost.
  - spellcheck: 'Slightly reformatted the wizard''s spellbook: multiple elements such
      as "requires wizard robes" and "lost on mind transfer" will stack on top of
      each other rather than one next to another, and the text for a spell that is
      capable of being used while unconscious is now green instead of blue.'
  - spellcheck: The "Summon Snacks" swapping description will now mention Dwarven
      snacks.
  - spellcheck: Fixed up the "Grease" wizard spell's empowerment message.
  - rscadd: Grues now take damage from lights based on constant exposure rather than
      at seemingly random intervals due to Life(), with a delay of 2 seconds before
      they take damage. This "timer" recovers by staying in darkness, at twice the
      normal speed it decays. The "darkness" indicator will also display differently-colored
      danger indicators for staying in the light, based on how long until the grue
      takes damage from the light.
  - tweak: Changed some things about the way the movement penalty and increasing light
      damage are done for grues. The movement penalty and increasing light damage
      will happen after the grue is burnt by the light and will persist for 2 seconds
      before resetting. Continued exposure to the light will, however, delay both
      from recovering.
  - tweak: The grue's "darkness" indicator will now update immediately.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where duplicate grue HUD icons would spawn constantly over
      and over.
  - tweak: The wizard's "Projectile Pastry" spell now happens from the wizard's location,
      rather than from the initial location where the spell was cast.
  brndd:
  - bugfix: Gasha captain, clown, mime and miner should now be using the correct sprites
  - rscadd: Added a new in-game guidebook for the supermatter engine. It can be found
      near your nearest supermatter engine.

  - tweak: a cargo centcom order coming in while an RC announcement is being written
      will no longer cancel the announcement
  - bugfix: centcom orders will no longer make the entire RC message list bold
2023-11-04:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed cable bolas being invisible.
  - bugfix: Fixed cable laying being prevented in some setups where it should be allowed.
  nervere:
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to walk out of the gibber.
2023-11-06:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: RCL no longer entirely prevent cable placement between two tiles if at
      least one of the tiles is valid (cables will still only be placed on the valid
      tile)
  - bugfix: Fixed a specific case where the RCL would place an extra unwanted node
      on your tile after clicking an adjacent tile that already had a node despite
      your tile already having a full wire going toward that tile.
  - rscadd: AltClicking an adjacent tile with the RCL equipped will cause it to try
      and absorb all the loose cable pieces on that tile
  DorainGrey:
  - bugfix: Engicoffee is now brewable again.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Laundromat vault, coming to a space quadrant near YOU! Do not go down
      the ladder.

  - tweak: Conveyor belts can now move specific numbers of items, controllable via
      multitool menu

  - tweak: Ablative deconstructable by science for combat 3 and materials 4
  - tweak: Ablative vest can be scanned by mechanics
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: The mech painter is instant and no longer takes 4 seconds to paint a mech.
  - rscadd: The Wizard's "Punch" spell will now also make both the wizard and their
      target immune to the damage caused by any shrapnel launched by the ensuing explosion.
      It will not, however, cancel any effect that the shrapnel may have, such as
      bolas entangling their targets.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where if a wizard used the "Punch" spell on a target frozen
      in time it would permanently displace their sprite.
  - tweak: Empowering Time Stop now costs 10 points instead of 20.
  brndd:
  - rscadd: Readded Wheelstation with some new changes and additions.
  - tweak: 'Boxstation: MoMMI nest starts out as a vacuum'
  - bugfix: Fixed incorrect directional sprites on the particle acceleration emitter.
  - rscadd: Service cyborgs now have a general-purpose drink synthesizer to replace
      their old space beer. This device can scan most types of drinks and then synthesize
      them out of battery power. They also come with a shaker, a rag and cooking tools
      out of the box, and get spicy chemicals and a new toy when emagged.
  - rscdel: The service cyborg chef upgrade has been removed as it is now part of
      their standard loadout.
  - tweak: Service gripper can now pick up more things (basically everything the Rapid
      Service Fabricator can create, plus things needed in the kitchen). The gripper
      can now be directly synthesized to from the RSF.
  - tweak: The Rapid Service Fabricator no longer throws sparks all over the place
      when selecting what to fabricate. Instead it plays a clicking sound.
  jwhitak:
  - bugfix: Welding tools now properly attack the head while targetting the eyes and
      mouth, instead of doing nothing.
  nervere:
  - tweak: Cyborgs are no longer disallowed from choosing the combat module on code
      delta.

  - bugfix: 'Wheelstation: made medbay airlocks not require access to bump open from
      the inside.'
  - bugfix: 'Wheelstation: removed some extraneous rad collectors and camera boards
      in engineering.'
  - tweak: 'Wheelstation: added masks and laser tag equipment to dorms, some more
      windows in medbay and around cargo, and one (1) coin.'
2023-11-09:
  brndd:
  - bugfix: 'Wheelstation: fixed missing turfs on supply shuttle'
2023-11-11:
  Eneocho:
  - bugfix: Maria's Hive (The Hivelord Queen) can now properly spawn in the asteroid.
  jwhitak:
  - tweak: Updated the Cargo Computers to have cleaner UIs.

  - rscadd: Added a printed manifest containing all of the Supply Shuttle's expected
      order contents which prints when the shuttle is called.

      forwards waiting to be processed.
  - rscadd: The call shuttle button is replaced with a timer that updates when you
      use the interface or click the computer (useful in the rare case the displays
      fail or don't exist).
  - tweak: Renamed the existing permissions for better clarity,
  - tweak: Bulk ordering crate popups are auto-selected and default to 0 crates.
  - tweak: Moves Vox/Plasmaman suit crates back to Clothes, adds N2/Plasma Internals
      crates to Supplies
  - tweak: Removes the Camera set out of the Arts and Crafts crate and puts it into
      a new Photography crate.
  - tweak: Grass now comes in a temperature controlled crate.
  - bugfix: Fixed a helper proc called _asc that sorted in descending order (and vice
      versa)...

  Volttekka:
  - rscadd: Thanks to >>453861032, you can now paint on floors with a paintbrush.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - rscadd: Castle Station has been modernized and will look far more like current
      Box Station. Notably, the Head of Personnel now has the Labor Administration
      Console as well as the photo booth, the Fore (northern) maintenance tunnels
      are larger, the Pod Bay has been moved, all the wires are now yellow and insulated
      gloves will once again have a semi-randomized position.
  - rscadd: Replaced Castle Station's beach jukebox with a super jukebox.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where players with high preferences in jobs that were not
      currently in the round could not open the Setup Character menu. This was notable
      on Castle Station with Security and Silicon jobs.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where high preferences for jobs that were not currently in
      the round would still appear on Manifest Prediction. This was most notable on
      Castle Station with Security and Silicons.
  - tweak: Assistants will no longer be limited if Security roles are disabled. This
      notably allows unlimited assistants on Castle Station.
  brndd:
  - rscadd: Added plushies and a claw machine to get them from. The claw machine can
      be found in the dormitories of most maps, except RoidStation where it's in the
      bar. It exchanges credits for regular plushies and coins for special plushies.
      Plushies can be hugged by attacking someone (including yourself) with one on
      help intent, and can have their stuffing removed with a sharp tool and replaced
      with a grenade.
  - bugfix: 'Wheelstation: fixed missing cargo crate weigher, broken cargo shuttle
      conveyor, wrong access on outpost NanoMed, backwards ore unloader on mining
      outpost.'
  - tweak: 'Wheelstation: added some more lights in maint and replaced the mini-mining
      outpost NanoMed with a wall-mounted one.'
  nervere:
  - tweak: Show-Server-Revision now also gives info on the server's current BYOND
      version.

      etc.

2023-11-25:
  DorainGrey:
  - bugfix: Fixed many many bugs on Horizon from first playtest.
2023-11-26:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Dynamic mode now resets Extended's incremental weight if a round ended
      with not a single ruleset executed (aka, de-facto Extended). These types of
      round would occur naturally on low threat, and since they wouldn't reset Extended's
      threat level it would instead increase and have even more chance to occur on
      the next round even if it had a higher threat level.
  DorainGrey:
  - tweak: Even more Horizon bug fixes
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: The RAM cost for Redundant Threading, Brightness Enhancer and Remote Signaler
      is now 10 (instead of 15).
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: Punctualite, a ghetto chemistry made chemical that explodes at the turn
      of the hour.
  ShiftyRail:

      containers if the previous one was empty.

  - rscadd: Blob cores in the shape of Security personnel now have a special Security
      blob skin available.
  - rscadd: Clowns will now honk bike horns and other horn-derived objects 4 times
      faster AKA twice per second.

  - rscadd: Added inhands sprites to plushies.
  nervere:
  - tweak: Stat collection has been re-enabled.
2023-11-28:
  DorainGrey:
  - bugfix: Fixes Horizon Destination tagging & Trader Outpost
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Makes the drug lab vault double layered for extra Z2 protection.
  - tweak: Extra fluff on the drug lab vault.
  - bugfix: The Laundromat should now properly spawn (I think).
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Being in your body as a ghost will now properly show messages as if you

      Using them to reinforce girders will result in the classic gold and silver walls.
2023-12-05:
  DeityLink:

2023-12-06:
  DorainGrey:
  - bugfix: Escape Pod Emagging does not break Horizon Shuttle
2023-12-08:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: Implemented a new subsystem that revamps the way reagent containers
      normalize their temperature in relation to the environment. This new method
      makes reagents reach room temperature quite faster on average (except when using
      a Stasis Beaker), and has been finely adjusted so temperature changes are more
      noticeable while also feeling realistic. You can Alt Middle click a beaker or
      food item to blow some air on them and accelerate the process. As an added bonus,
      this system consumes a negligible amount of CPU compared to the one in effect
      until now, and is much simpler to read and adjust, thus more maintainable.
  - experiment: The thermal dissipation subsystem has been disabled
  DorainGrey:
  - bugfix: Fixes Horizon ERT, Nuke Squads and death squads.

      hitsound for mobs instead.
2023-12-10:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: The Paint & Linen Update is here! A world of acrylic, fabric, and
      glue opens before you.
  - experiment: 'Detailed changelog here: `https://github.com/vgstation-coders/vgstation13/pull/35451`'
  - rscadd: Reworked from scratch how paint mixes and interact with floors, walls,
      and everything in general. You can craft acrylic paint in Chemistry by first
      mixing glue, and then adding some pigments.
  - rscadd: Glue is a new (previously unused) reagent that applies to object the same
      effect that school glue applies, but for only a minute. Can be washed off with
      water. Creates splatters on the floor that slow down mobs.
  - rscadd: You can use Paint Rollers from Art Vendors to paint floors and walls without
      consuming reagents, and painting only parts of a tile.
  - rscadd: Paint Remover has been reworked into Acetone, and can be obtained either
      from the Art Vendor, or brewed in Chemistry.
  - rscadd: 'Added a new Vox Trader bundle: the Nano Painter''s toolbox. Nano Paint
      when applied over a whole tile will cause it to emit its own light. When used
      on canvas the parts painted with it will glow in the dark.'
  - rscadd: Nano Paint may also be crafted in Xenobiology by adding Phazon to a Pyrite
      Slime.
  - rscadd: Added a new Botany plant, Flax, whose product can be either grinded for
      Flax Oil which is a type of paint that partially matches the color of its surrounding
      reagents (pouring the mixture between two beakers a few times will cause the
      flax oil to match the other reagents' color completely). Flax may also be processed
      into cloth using either a Spinning Wheel crafted out of Wood, or an Electric
      Loom produced by R&D.
  - rscadd: Cloth can now be used to craft some simple items by hand, or more intricate
      clothing by using Knitting Needles crafted out of wood, or a Sewing Machine
      produced by R&D.
  - rscadd: After adding some pigments inside a cauldron, you can dye crafted items
      in it either fully, or partially depending on the item. Bedsheets can be dyed
      as well.
  - rscadd: Using Knitting Needles or a Sewing Machine, you can toggle the appearance
      of bedsheets between their old plaid look and their new wider look.
  - rscadd: R&D may also now print the High Roller, a large paint roller that lets
      you easily and efficiently apply reagents over a large area. This applies to
      paint, but also bleach, acetone, lube, everything you can think of. If the reagent
      is a pigment, it will cover floors like paint does.
  - imageadd: Re-Sprited Painting Brushes, Palettes, Paint Buckets, and added in-hand
      icons for all.
  - rscadd: Metal Buckets similar to Paint Buckets can now be crafted from metal sheets.
  - tweak: the old Bucket is now called Plastic Bucket, and can be crafted from Plastic,
      or from the Biogenerator.
  - tweak: the Colorful Syndrome disease effect has been reworked, and now splatters
      the surroundings of the infected mob with paint instead of using chem smoke.
  - rscadd: You can now toggle hoods on mannequins or other players by using the stripping
      menu.
  - tweak: Some machines now automatically appear higher when built on top of tables,
      or when tables are placed below them, and return to their default offset when
      the table is removed or flipped.
2023-12-11:

      the ground.

      making disease a pain and a half to cure.
  boy2mantwicethefam:

2024-02-18:
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Traitors can now buy the Dirty Bomb Artillery Remote, a device that detonates
      a dirty bomb in orbit and causes a radstorm on-demand. This storm behaves as
      a regular radstorm, but will report the area the remote was used on upon notifying
      the crew.
  MercuriusGH:
  - imageadd: Added grey sprites for eye tracking hud
2024-02-19:

  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added 3 microwaves to Snaxi. One in the Escape hallway, one in front of
      Medbay, and one in front of the Bar. Crew-members can use those to warm up their
      food items after coming out of a snow storm. (The food items would reach room
      temperature quickly on their own anyway, but this is a pretty pro-immulsions
      way to do it)
  RealestEstate:
  - rscadd: PAI can uninstall software to make room for others. The process takes
      some time and must complete before the RAM can be refunded.
  - imageadd: The once available dark purple and dark green hoodies are back in stock
      again

  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added the Soulblade Sanctum vault
  - tweak: Food and reagents in your hands and backpack no longer freeze while in
      space. They may be allowed to freeze by dropping them directly onto a space
      turf still. In more general terms, held items and ones in containers now experience
      reduced or no entropy in low pressure environments.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: The Phazon-Nothing reaction now costs 1u of phazon and 1u of Nothing to
      make, and gives 5u of reagent in return. It now requires 5u of Mutagen and 5u
      of Enzyme as catalysts instead of 10 of each.
  - rscadd: Spessmen might find themselves affected by Lime Disease, and are advised
      to procure some salt and tequila in that case.

  - rscdel: 'Blob: Blobs can no longer appear at roundstart.'
  - rscadd: 'Blob: Manual blob expansion no longer has a 75% chance to fail when expanding
      into space, which would waste the chemicals in the process.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Midround blobs now produce twice as many chemicals per second (2
      -> 4).'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Manual blob expansion now costs 5 chemicals instead of 15.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Blobs now deal 50% brute damage and 50% burn damage when attacking.
      Stock up on that burn medication, and diona beware!'
  - rscadd: 'Blob: Blobs will now ignore half of a target''s armor value when calculating
      damage. Some of the defensive values would lead to absurd amounts of protection
      against the blob.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Strong blob tiles now have 50 health, down from 75, which means
      less hits are required to destroy them (3 Liberator/Antique Laser Gun shots,
      4 regular laser shots, down from 4 and 5-6 respectively).'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Blob tiles now have a 50% chance to successfully spread into space
      instead of 25%. Useful, as the midround blob comes from outer space.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Resource blobs now cost 10 points instead of 30 points, meaning
      they will make a return on their investment after 1 minute and 20 seconds at
      earliest instead of 4 minutes.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Liberator laser gun shots will now deal 25 damage to blobs instead
      of 40, which is the default for anything that isn''t humanoid, and deal half
      of their damage to a nearby blob tile on hit, which means a Liberator shot can
      destroy a blob tile and damage another in one shot rather than destroy two blob
      tiles. Fire in a formation!'
  - rscadd: 'Blob: Midround blobs can now influence the round''s episode name.'
  - rscdel: Auto-ignition mechanics from air temperature has been disabled, and will
      now require previous conventional sources of being set on fire in order to be
      on fire.

      the "No Gun Allowed" restriction multiple times, provided that he had extra
      spellbooks.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the "No Gun Allowed" restriction wasn't transferred
      when the wizard transformed into something else, meaning that they would be
      able to use guns.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where artifacts that could be purchased only one time could
      be repurchased again after buying the wizard's spellbook bundle or after summoning
      magic, which also fixes an exploit where it was possible to infinitely buy Summon

      "Range: Self".'

      update their sprites rather than after a short moment.
  - bugfix: Fixed a nearly 5 years old bug where Fireball could be used while pacified.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where it was impossible to buy Fireball after buying Fire
      Breath. Fire Breath is now its own independent spell, and the way the spellbook
      searches for known spells in a player's mind has been changed to fix the edge-case
      bug where buying a sub-type of a spell would prevent that spell from being purchased.
  - bugfix: Targeting someone directly with Pacify will now cast the spell at their
      location.
  - bugfix: Pacify can no longer be targeted at tiles that are not in the player's

      salt respectively.
  RealestEstate:
  - rscadd: Bioballistic Delivery System now has a multi-splice option which allows
      for multiple splices in one go. The time to complete the splice will scale proportionally
      with the number of splices so a large amount of splices will take longer to
      complete.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: The Magic Closet's other spells that bring the wizard to it or bring the
      closet to the wizard will no longer go on cooldown if the closet does not exist.

      removed.
  - bugfix: The Prestidigitation, Santa bundle and No Gun Allowed spells will now
      be properly considered wizard-specific spells when purchased from the spellbook.

  - rscadd: The "Sleight of Teeth" vampire ability has been improved; It will no longer
      take an initial 30 seconds before starting the process, it will not inform the
      victim nor any nearby target of the blood sucking and it will not deal 1 brute
      damage compared to regular blood-sucking. Dine and dash today!

      due to rounding.

  - rscadd: Cultists have a new UI Panel that enables easier tracking of the cult's
      members, their objectives, and lots of other important information.
  - rscadd: As cultists perform occult activities and complete objectives, they generate
      devotion which both grants them Tattoos imbued with new powers, but also quickens
      the arrival of the new Eclipse event.
  - rscadd: During the Eclipse, all lights aboard the station are dimmed, highly reducing
      visibility. The cult can use the new (very old in fact) Tear Reality rune during

      ends without the ritual being attempted, the crew will be safe from Nar-Sie
      for this round.
  - rscadd: If the cult attempts to raise Nar-Sie, they will have to defend a Blood
      Stone for a certain amount of time, and from that point onward all cultists
      will have a visible halo betraying their appearance to the crew. If the Blood
      Stone is destroyed, the ritual will end, and the cult will receive various handicaps,
      such has the halo remaining visible, and the cultist cap falling to zero.
  - rscadd: The Scoreboard now lists cultists in order of how much devotion they generated.
      The cult now "wins" or "loses" following various conditions, each with a different
      message on the scoreboard. A cult that couldn't raise Nar-Sie can still get
      a victory by having some of its members escape alive and free aboard the shuttle.
  - rscadd: The Eclipse event also has a small chance to occur during non-cult rounds,
      keeping some uncertainty around until actual occult shit is witnessed.
  - experiment: Check the detailed changelog linked in
  - bugfix: Fixed hair and facial hair always appearing black and on top on photos

      menu when it didn't have any (such as the No Gun Allowed spell)

      monkeys already take damage through other systems.
  - bugfix: Fixed a 7-year-old bug where slimes wouldn't do roughly 4 of the emotes
      they were meant to do once in a while because the emote system was checking

      and vibrate.
  - rscdel: Creatures and silicons that are attacked by burn-causing melee weapons
      such as the scrying orb will no longer be spammed with "Aargh it burns!" in
      every attack.
  - bugfix: Cleaned a section of the game's code where item attacks against slimes

      say "they surrender%s!", and will now properly say "they surrender!".
