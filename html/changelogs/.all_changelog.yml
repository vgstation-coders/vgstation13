  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Mice once again may periodically squeek. They also will squeek if you
      step on them while they're conscious.
  - rscadd: The Vacuum Dishwasher from the Vox Traders' Zinc Saucier's crate now has
      density, improved visual and audio feedback reflecting its state or when vacuuming
      and cleaning plates, as well as some minor bugs fixed.
  nervere:
  - bugfix: Fixed instruments breaking when a song has a space (comma) at the end
      of a line
  - rscadd: Added alt-click functionality to advanced pinpointer to change its mode
  - bugfix: Fixed coordinate tracking functionality on advanced pinpointer not working
  - tweak: 'WAY: Added lightswitch to kitchen.'
  - tweak: 'WAY: Re-oriented genetics to make it easier to break out of if necessary.'
  - tweak: 'WAY: Added new fire extinguisher to central hallway loop.'
  - tweak: 'WAY: Fixed half of trader outpost''s solar panels not having wire knots
      under them.'
  - tweak: 'WAY: Fixed disposals not having a vent/scrubber.'
  - tweak: 'WAY: Mechanics now have access to telecomms.'
  - rscadd: Light Replacers have been greatly improved. You may now click a tile to
      replace/upgrade the light fixture on it, or to pick up all broken lights found
      on that tile. This functionality is available for all types (normal, advanced,
      cyborg, etc.).
  - rscadd: Added chat messages for some uses of the light replacer.
  - rscdel: Removed redundant and broken refresh button on janitor PDA cartridge.
  - bugfix: Janitor PDA's now properly show the direction in which whichever item
      you're looking for is. Locate your equipment much easier!

  pedr69:
  - rscadd: AI's now get an audio beep when requested at a holopad
2023-06-24:
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Getmore and Discount Dan's have started stocking their machines with mint
      candy. Getmore sells a pack for 30 credits, while Discount Dan's sells them
      for a coin, as it is one of the rare non toxic items they sell, and that cuts
      into profits. The old vendortron somehow got access to a homemade brand of mints.
  - rscadd: Mint Essence, only available inside mint candy, it is the unrefined version
      of Mint Toxin, being perfectly safe to consume.
  - rscadd: Mint Toxin and Mint Essence will keep you minty fresh. This helps with
      heat (like drinking iced coffee) and gives you an ever so slight boost to sports
      performance (same level as sugar).
  - rscadd: Being minty fresh and drinking ice water might cause dental pain. Drinking
      coffee immediately afterwards will cause some less than desirable effects to
      your dental health.
  - bugfix: Fixes some icon issues with the icons calling for a pill bottle label.
  - tweak: Made the NT icon for the NT mints blue, instead of green.
2023-06-27:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Regular blob tiles once again (after 7 years) visibly brighten when a
      pulse passes through them. Pulses are emitted by Cores, Nodes, and Overminds.
      So if you see some nearby blob blinking brightly despite no Node being nearby,
      that means the Overmind currently has their attention on you. Hopefully it shouldn't
      cause more CPU usage this time.
  - rscadd: Blob Cores and Nodes now emit light, whose color depends upon which skin
      has been selected
  - tweak: The Blob Core and Node pulse animations once again render above darkness,
      like they were meant to.
  - bugfix: Fixed Blob turning shuttle tiles black when expanding over them.
  - bugfix: Fixed some roundstart Blob ruleset initialization issue that could lead
      to the blob getting extra antag roles if multiple roundstart rulesets fire together.
  - bugfix: Fixed some animations (such as the cult teleport animations) ending about
      a second earlier than they should.
  - bugfix: Parallax wraparound has finally been fixed, you will no longer leave stars
      behind forever if you keep moving in one direction in space.
  - bugfix: Fixed hookshots and their chains not being visible in many cases.
  - bugfix: Fixed hookshots having a much shorter range when firing in diagonals.
  - bugfix: Fixed hookshots failing to properly reel you in if the hook hits something
      at the longest range possible.
  - bugfix: Fixed a sanity issue that occurred when mobs exit a Cryo Tube, Body Scanner,
      DNA Scanner, Mecha, or Cyborg Recharging Station through teleportation or getting
      pulled by a hookshot chain, and that would either allow other players to teleport
      them back to it, or just prevent the object from being used by other players.
  - rscadd: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Players that have no roles when the clock hits the automated
      ERT call now become Survivors. Latejoiners that don''t have Traitor enabled
      get that role as well.'
  - tweak: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Changed some of the messages sent to latejoin traitors
      to have them better notice that this isn''t a regular antag roll.'
  - tweak: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Attempting to call the ERT early will now always result
      in a failure (note that it won''t prevent the automated ERT call to occur after
      20 minutes).'
  - tweak: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Reduced the ERT call delay from 20 to 18 minutes (so the
      ERT may actually arrive at the Station after 20 minutes)'
  - tweak: 'ANTAG MADNESS: During that mode, the Blob-related biohazard announcement
      will now trigger much later, but the Blob will also be unable to spawn any additional
      Blob Cores.'
  - bugfix: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Fixed Nanotrasen Officials not getting their Survive objective
      unless they latejoined.'
  - tweak: If a faction's defeat is supposed to reduce the security level and call
      the shuttle, it will only do so if no other faction also has the shuttle under
      lockdown or warrants a higher security level.
  - imageadd: Added a new logo and Greeting message for Survivors that aren't created
      by Wizards summoning guns.
  DorainGrey:
  - rscadd: Adds a radio for Nukies, where they can request reinforcement and get
      extra TC in exchange for waiting 10 minutes during the ensuing bluespace distortion.
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: There is now an art vendor. Coming soon to a library near you.
  - rscadd: The librarian can now request the removal of a book from the library database
      with a button. Do your civic duty and delete the garbage.
  - rscadd: Librarians and admins can now preview a book in the database without ordering
      it.
  - bugfix: Books should not briefly flash a different cover when first ordered from
      the checkout computer.
  gurfan:
  - bugfix: Product lists can now be imported into cash registers again.
  jellyveggie2:
  - rscadd: Pressure valves can now also compare temperature, and have been renamed
      to conditional valves.
  - tweak: Conditional valves can now also compare the control pipe against the input
      pipes' gases, rather than just a fixed value.
  - tweak: Conditional valves can now also forego the side input entirely, using either
      of the two other pipes as control. This might help make some designs neater
      and more compact.
  - rscdel: Conditional valves can no longer be controlled via AAC, beyond simple
      on/off commands.
  nervere:
  - rscadd: Deadchat is now notified when and where a player dies, with an option
      to jump to that player's location.

  - rscadd: 'LOWFATBAGEL: An additional exit to atmospherics has been added to make

      slime puddle.
  - bugfix: Arcane Tampering is now properly cleared from all objects when a wizard
      dies.
  - bugfix: Fixed orange hardhat sprites being at an incorrect position for insectoids.
  - bugfix: Slimepeople can be cloned once more. Simply put the slime puddle inside
      the cloning machine and scan. Make sure it has its slime core (brain) inside
      or it won't work!
  - tweak: Slimepeople now take toxins damage when cloning instead of clone damage.
      This is to prevent them from instantly cloning (as they're immune to cloneloss),
      while also providing a way for xenobio to ease their cloning process (through
      giving them a slime heart).
  - bugfix: The PDA pinpointer will no longer display negative values when showing
      the time until its next scan.
  smonkeM:
  - rscadd: Added one new reagent, one new spray bottle, and added this to the AutoDrobe's
      contraband section
  - rscdel: Apparently I deleted two lines somewhere. And then added two lines. I'm
      an idiot and I don't believe this breaks anything?
2023-07-01:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Mobs can now attack blob tiles empty handed. Obviously puny humans won't
      do much damage at all given its inherent resistance to brute damage, but at
      least this allow mobs like aliums and constructs to do decent damage to the
      blob. Blob tiles also now take damage from thrown objects.
  nervere:
  - bugfix: Fixed light replacers not being able to replace bulb-less light fixtures
  - bugfix: Fixed runtime when a light fixture's fitting var is set to null for some
      reason (???)

      a whole, instead of each individual layer.

  - bugfix: Fixed the "Jump to Blob Core" button at the top left of the screen of
      Blob players not working properly.

      from very high and low temperatures.

      glasses equipped in most cases when their job outfit already includes some glasses,
      even if those had a prescription version.
  - imageadd: Prescription Health Scanner HUDs have a new sprite and are now called
      Health Scanner Glasses. They can also now be printed at R&D, and both them and
      the regular Health Scanner HUDs can be found in medical lockers.

      as a premium item, while plastic ones can be crafted from plastic sheets.
  - imageadd: Forks, Spoons and Sporks now all have in-hand icons.

      the surrounding atmosphere by 1000 Kelvin. Discounted for Atmospheric Technicians

      temperature instead.
  - bugfix: Fixed plastic spoons and sporks not having in-hand icons.
  - bugfix: Fixed the issue where hobo shacks could lack an APC if two of them spawned.
      Each shack is now properly its own area.

      feet.

  - bugfix: Fixed AIs being able to see at a higher invisibility level than their
      intended one.
  - rscadd: Station Holomaps now feature a button on their interface that you can

      have your workplace on the displayed Z Level, and are wearing identification
      featuring a valid rank.
  - rscadd: The Bhangmeter now functions like a Station Holomap. Touching it displays
      a map of the station over which are displayed the areas affected by explosions.
      Recent explosions appear bright and opaque, then slowly fade away over 5 minutes
      until they remain at half transparency. Incoming meteor/object waves and the
      direction they come from are also indicated.
  - rscadd: You can access the new Bhangmeter panel featuring a table of all recorded
      explosions by clicking the Database interface button visible on the holomap.
      Explosions are recorded from most recent to oldest, and per Z level, so if you
      want to see the Asteroid's explosions, you'll need to use a Bhangmeter on the
      Asteroid Z level.
  - rscadd: Explosions caused by the Pipe Gun (aka Blast Canon) now spread in a cone
      shape. Just like with regular explosions, each affected tile now checks for
      things that could dampen the explosion between them and the epicenter.
  - rscadd: The round-end scoreboard now gives the round's largest TTV explosion,
      with an extra mention if it reached maxcap.
  - imageadd: Added additional in-hand sprites for TTV depending on which tanks are
      on them.
  - imageadd: Improved the Pipe Gun (aka Blast Cannon)'s in-hand sprite, and added
      a variation for when it has a TTV equipped on it.
  - imageadd: The Bhangmeter has a new sprite, finally differentiating it from the
      Detective's Forensic computer.
  - bugfix: When the bhangmeter announces information, it does so by "coldly stating"
      which it hasn't done since at least 2016.
  - rscdel: As they were mostly broken and unused, and extended greatly the duration
      of roundstart initialization, NanoUI minimap generation has been disabled. The
      only feature that still uses them is the Central Atmospherics Computer which
      will now display its markers over empty space when you display its Tracking
      Map. In return, we've shaved off 10-20 seconds of roundstart init.
  gurfan:
  - tweak: Added Hawaii tourist uniform sprites for Vox/Insectoids/Greys
  nervere:
  - imageadd: New HD item icon for the Funk Boots added, all spritework done by Blithering.
2023-07-17:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixes roundstart players appearing naked on their medical and security
      records
  - tweak: Plasmamen using the Summon Robes rune now actually get cult robes. The
      old armor that used to spawn can still be purchased from traders, and now actually
      provides cult benefits when equipped.
  - tweak: When using the Summon Robes rune, plasmamen now keep their plasma tank
      in their suit slot. And when using the blood tesseract, their cult suit and
      hood are now deleted and replaced with the suit and helmet they had stored in
      it.
  - bugfix: Fixed Cult Armor and Helmets not regulating the body temperature of plasmamen
      or extinguishing them.
  - imageadd: Plasmaman Cult Armor and Helmet are now animated.
  - bugfix: Fixed monkey clothes not having their in-hand sprites show up.
  - rscadd: Added Winter Cult Robes and Hood for all species (even monkeys). Those
      will appear in place of regular robes when using the Summon Robes rune on the
      snow Z Level.
  - bugfix: AIs using their Station Holomaps on other Z Level will now see the proper
      map (and as it is for regular Station/Cyborg Holomaps, only the Station, Asteroid,
      and Derelict Z levels have detailed maps)
  - bugfix: Prescription Glasses once again properly transfer their effect to Mesons
      or similar glasses put over them.
  - bugfix: Fixed some glasses that were meant to have corrective lenses not actually
      having them (prescription diagnostic HUD and hydroHUD).
  - tweak: Touching a Station Holomap that you are currently already watching now
      makes you stop watching it.
  - bugfix: This makes it so that you won't get extra non-removable Workplace Finder
      buttons on your screen.
  - experiment: Dynamic rulesets now have their weight increase linearly round after
      round until they get to proc, upon which it gets reset to 1 (at round end).
      This experiment should allow rarer rulesets with complicated pre-requirements
      to be more likely to fire when they finally meet those, while rulesets that
      have just fired will have dramatically reduced chances to fire again on the
      next round(s) (unless they are the only valid ruleset for a given threat and
      pop configuration of course)
  Eneocho:
  - spellcheck: Deathnettles now properly say "stings" or "pricks" as the attackverb
      instead of "stings, pricks".

      damage bruises healing without treatment.

      from your inventory if you close and re-open the game, being unable to un-equip
      or re-equip your backpack, having an unused uniform slot, being unable to strip
      crew members or getting stripped yourself, etc...
  - bugfix: Fixed Santa's Bag being able to carry way less items than it was supposed
      to. The Grinch's bag is now a sub-type of santa's bag.
  - imageadd: The Grinch now has its own logo for the scoreboard.
  - imageadd: The Grinch bag now looks like the wizard's Santa bag. Both bags now
      also visually grow larger as you fit more items in them, and both bags now have

  - rscadd: The spacesuit modification station will now say why a module was not installed.
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: "Solar Panels no longer sometimes do an almost complete rotation when\
      \ their target orientation requires them to pass through the 0\xB0|360\xB0 mark."
  - imageadd: Solar Panels are no longer visually constrained to 8 directions, and
      can be observed rotating in real time.
  - rscadd: Solar Panels can now generate powers even if they aren't connected to
      a Solar Panel Control computer.
  - rscadd: Players can now use a wrench on Solar Panels to change their rotation
      manually. Rotating them this way is faster than doing it from a computer, but
      you need to remain adjacent until the rotation is over or it will be incomplete.
  - rscadd: Solar Panels are now affected by EMPs, which cause them to spin to a random
      orientation. They will re-calibrate themselves on their own as long as they
      are connected to a working Solar Panel Control computer.
  - imageadd: Solar Panels now feature visual cracks when they've taken some damage,
      but not enough to break them. Since damage reduces their power output, this
      lets you identify at a glance which panels need repairs.
  - rscadd: Attacking a Solar Panel with a weapon now gives visual and textual feedback
  - rscadd: Simple Animals and Aliens can now attack solar panels.
  - rscadd: Added proper descriptions to both Solar Panels and Solar Trackers.
  - rscadd: Solar Panels can now be distinguished through darkness, and their panel
      becomes fully lit when in direct view of the star.
  - imageadd: The color of Solar Panels now brightens slightly the better aligned
      with the star it is, producing a visible glow at near-perfect alignment.
  - bugfix: Fixed Solar Panels not emitting any power in some cases despite them being
      nearly aligned with the sun.
  - tweak: Solar Trackers now actually need line of sight to the star to provide its
      angle. Despite them iconically being mapped at the extremity of solar arrays,
      you could just build them inside the station.
  - imageadd: Solar Trackers now have a broken sprite. While broken, they cannot be
      used by Solar Panel Control computers to automatically track the star. They
      also now more clearly indicate the current star's rotation as long as they have
      sight of it, while a solar tracker without view of a star will appear noticeable
      darker.
  - tweak: Catwalks have had their cost reduced from 3 metal rods to just 2 (both
      including the 1 rod lattice cost). Their construction time has also been halved.
  - tweak: You no longer have a chance to slip when walking on catwalks.
  - bugfix: Fixed an edge case where placing cables in space didn't check for proper
      support.
  - rscadd: Player-controlled mice now visibly rest.
  - rscadd: The Rapid Cable Layer (RCL) has been rewritten from scratch and is now
      much easier to use and less prone to accidentally placing unwanted wire knots.
      You can click adjacent tiles directly to create a pair of wires that connects
      both that tile and yours (and that tries to connect to existing nodes on both
      tiles even if you didn't pixel-perfect clicked them). Placing wires this way,
      or clicking the RCL enables its active mode, during which you can lay wires
      by just walking around. Unlike previously the RCL won't attempt to place extra
      nodes on tiles that already have wires connecting from the same direction, but
      you can still force that behaviour when clicking tiles. Clicking the RCL again
      disables it.
  - rscadd: RCL added to YouTool vendors at a premium, and Engi-Vends as part of their
      regular stock.
  - rscadd: Electricians (the Station Engineer alt-job) spawn with their own RCL in
      their backpack, and holding an electrical toolbox.
  - imageadd: Of course the RCL had its sprites revamped and now displays not only
      better how much wire is in it, but also its color.
  - bugfix: Fixed cable coil always appearing red in your character's hands despite
      sprites for other colours existing.
  - rscadd: Actually fuck those sprites, cables are now entirely coloured through
      code, and you can paint coils by dipping them in reagent containers containing
      reagents flagged as pigments (such as paint buckets, but blood and a few others
      work as well). The colour carries over to placed wires and cable cuffs.
  Irradiation:
  - rscadd: 'Metaclub: Added a Bhangmeter to the bridge.'
  - rscadd: 'Metaclub: Added some missing wires to power up some electrified grilles.'
  - tweak: 'Metaclub: Remodeled the Bridge command room to accommodate the Bhangmeter.'
  - tweak: Sleep Toxin now has an overdose amount (30 units) that will deal some toxin
      damage if you go over it.
  - tweak: Sleep Toxin will now start destroying your heart if it's in your system
      for more than 8 minutes.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the target that was initially hit by the wizard's "Lightning"
      spell would randomly cause the Lightning spell to not arc to nearby targets
      and randomly hit the same target twice. The Lightning spell will now properly
      arc to other targets and not have a random chance to instantly put someone into
      critical condition while at it.
  - bugfix: The wizard that casts the 'Lightning" spell will no longer be a valid
      target to be dealt damage to, which was caused by the Lightning spell arcing
      to a target that the wizard was in the way of. However, it will still arc off
      the wizard if it is able to do so.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused Pain Mirror to be able to indefinitely ping-pong
      between different Pain Mirror users, provided that they were not human. This
      was, most notably, possible with the wizard's Arcane Golems.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where detaching a mech's jetpack while the jetpack was active
      would render the mech permanently immobile.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where MMIs and posibrains getting inserted into a mech would
      not update its sprite, making it appear as if it was not occupied until they
      moved.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where MMIs and posibrains getting inserted into a mech would
      not have their spell menu appear until their equipment changed.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where users did not receive any message when failing to insert
      a posibrain into a mech with a DNA-lock active, because the posibrain does not
      have a DNA.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where a mech that had its hydraulic clamp removed could still
      automatically collect ore when digging.
  - spellcheck: Added more descriptive messages for when trying to insert an MMI or
      posibrain into a mech with a DNA-lock active.
  - tweak: Grues will no longer see the red damage overlay as they get more damaged.
  - tweak: Civil War of Casters is slightly more likely to happen.
  - tweak: Grues will now nuzzle other grues instead of hitting them.
  - rscadd: Grues will now become increasingly more effective against armored targets
      the more people they eat. After eating 5 people they will reach the limit of
      reducing damage reduction by 50%, multiplicatively.
  - tweak: Grues are now limited to a maximum of 50 damage per hit.
  - tweak: Grues will gain slightly less damage out of every consumed player, from
      7 to 5.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the vampire's Glare ability worked while blindfolded.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where shapeshifted vampires didn't initially update their
      visible name when shapeshifting with no ID.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where a max-power vampire using the Screech ability would
      get a backlash from every single nearby null rod wearer rather than just one.
      This also means the Screech ability will be properly stopped and blocked rather
      than still affecting everyone in the vicinity.
  - bugfix: Null rods carried by people with ear protection will now properly cause
      a backlash against max-power vampires using the Screech ability instead of doing
      nothing.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the vampire's Screech ability would play its sound for
      every single target. It will now only play once per Screech.
  - tweak: Reduced the amount of jittering caused by the vampire's Screech ability
      from 5 minutes to 40 seconds.
  - tweak: The vampire's Screech ability can be used at any time, rather than only
      when there are living targets nearby.
  - tweak: Failing to Enthrall someone as a vampire will no longer put the ability
      on cooldown.
  - tweak: Failing to Hypnotise someone as a vampire, whether because they are blind
      or for other reasons, will no longer put the ability on cooldown.
  - tweak: Vampire abilities that get backlashed by null rods will now go on cooldown.
      This also fixed a bug where the max-power vampire's Glare ability could be spammed
      non-stop.
  - spellcheck: Fixed a tiny typo regarding the message that a vampire receives when
      a null rod causes a backlash.
  - spellcheck: Fixed a tiny typo regarding the message that a victim of a vampire's
      Screech receives. This also extends to the NPC vampire creature.
  brndd:
  - rscadd: PackedStation now has a pneumatic disposals system.
  - tweak: Dionae are now about 33% faster, making them slightly faster than using
      a wheelchair.

  - bugfix: The paramedic winter coat suit slot now uses the correct list of objects.
  jellyveggie2:
  - rscadd: Adds a ghost costume to the halloween costume crate.
  - rscadd: You may also craft your own ghost costume by cutting up a bed sheet while
      targeting the eyes.
  - tweak: A number of robes now have toggleable hoods, just like winter coats.
  - rscadd: Added a face paint spray can to the Halloween costume crate. Use in hand
      to switch modes. Use paper aiming at your head to clean it off.
  jwhitak:
  - bugfix: Low pop events that weren't supposed to fire will no longer fire.
  - bugfix: Vines, Biomass, and Carp need 7 active players.
  - bugfix: Powercreeper, Meteors (Waves/Showers), and Immovable Rods (Small/Large)
      need 7 active players with at least 1 Engineer.
  toomykins:
  - tweak: boxstation's medbay now has a  light switch
  - tweak: roidstation's HoP OFFICE, HoP personal quarters and the abandoned smithy
      now have a light switch
  - rscadd: boxstation tradefloor now has a double airlock system
  - tweak: boxstation research outposts now has a soldering iron
  - tweak: boxstation AI integrity restorer is now named correctly.
  - tweak: boxstation incinerator air outlet now has unique frequency and id_tag
  - tweak: boxstation HoS office shutters now start at the correct density

  gurfan:
  - rscadd: 'Added new thing: you can eat borers now. literally just pick them up
      and eat them.'
  jwhitak:
  - tweak: Radstorms no longer fire unless there's at least 7 active space mans.
2023-10-31:
  toomykins:

      upon spooking
2023-11-01:
  ValkyrieSkies:

  - tweak: Moved Vox & Plasmaman internal supply crates to the Supplies category
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - rscadd: The wizard's spellbook will now tell you which spell is lost upon transferring
      minds with spells such as Mind Swap.
  - rscadd: The wizard's spellbook will now tell you a spell's range once purchased.
  - rscadd: Many spells in the wizard's spellbook will be more descriptive when their
      attribute buttons (such as cooldown and power) are pressed. Most notably, the
      cooldown button will tell you by how many seconds the cooldown is reduced.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the "Card Trick" spell could be acquired from the spellbook
      bundle's ancient spellbook.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the "Chariot" spell could have its cooldown reduced
      despite being a one-time-use spell that summons a Firebird vehicle.
  - spellcheck: The wizard's spellbook will now display "MAXED!" for a maxed spell
      level rather than the upgrade cost.
  - spellcheck: 'Slightly reformatted the wizard''s spellbook: multiple elements such
      as "requires wizard robes" and "lost on mind transfer" will stack on top of
      each other rather than one next to another, and the text for a spell that is
      capable of being used while unconscious is now green instead of blue.'
  - spellcheck: The "Summon Snacks" swapping description will now mention Dwarven
      snacks.
  - spellcheck: Fixed up the "Grease" wizard spell's empowerment message.
  - rscadd: Grues now take damage from lights based on constant exposure rather than
      at seemingly random intervals due to Life(), with a delay of 2 seconds before
      they take damage. This "timer" recovers by staying in darkness, at twice the
      normal speed it decays. The "darkness" indicator will also display differently-colored
      danger indicators for staying in the light, based on how long until the grue
      takes damage from the light.
  - tweak: Changed some things about the way the movement penalty and increasing light
      damage are done for grues. The movement penalty and increasing light damage
      will happen after the grue is burnt by the light and will persist for 2 seconds
      before resetting. Continued exposure to the light will, however, delay both
      from recovering.
  - tweak: The grue's "darkness" indicator will now update immediately.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where duplicate grue HUD icons would spawn constantly over
      and over.
  - tweak: The wizard's "Projectile Pastry" spell now happens from the wizard's location,
      rather than from the initial location where the spell was cast.
  brndd:
  - bugfix: Gasha captain, clown, mime and miner should now be using the correct sprites
  - rscadd: Added a new in-game guidebook for the supermatter engine. It can be found
      near your nearest supermatter engine.

      will no longer cancel the announcement
  - bugfix: centcom orders will no longer make the entire RC message list bold
2023-11-04:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed cable bolas being invisible.
  - bugfix: Fixed cable laying being prevented in some setups where it should be allowed.
  nervere:
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to walk out of the gibber.
2023-11-06:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: RCL no longer entirely prevent cable placement between two tiles if at
      least one of the tiles is valid (cables will still only be placed on the valid
      tile)
  - bugfix: Fixed a specific case where the RCL would place an extra unwanted node
      on your tile after clicking an adjacent tile that already had a node despite
      your tile already having a full wire going toward that tile.
  - rscadd: AltClicking an adjacent tile with the RCL equipped will cause it to try
      and absorb all the loose cable pieces on that tile
  DorainGrey:
  - bugfix: Engicoffee is now brewable again.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Laundromat vault, coming to a space quadrant near YOU! Do not go down
      the ladder.
  GreatBigFailure:
  - tweak: Conveyor belts can now move specific numbers of items, controllable via
      multitool menu

  - tweak: Ablative deconstructable by science for combat 3 and materials 4
  - tweak: Ablative vest can be scanned by mechanics
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: The mech painter is instant and no longer takes 4 seconds to paint a mech.
  - rscadd: The Wizard's "Punch" spell will now also make both the wizard and their
      target immune to the damage caused by any shrapnel launched by the ensuing explosion.
      It will not, however, cancel any effect that the shrapnel may have, such as
      bolas entangling their targets.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where if a wizard used the "Punch" spell on a target frozen
      in time it would permanently displace their sprite.
  - tweak: Empowering Time Stop now costs 10 points instead of 20.
  brndd:
  - rscadd: Readded Wheelstation with some new changes and additions.
  - tweak: 'Boxstation: MoMMI nest starts out as a vacuum'
  - bugfix: Fixed incorrect directional sprites on the particle acceleration emitter.
  - rscadd: Service cyborgs now have a general-purpose drink synthesizer to replace
      their old space beer. This device can scan most types of drinks and then synthesize
      them out of battery power. They also come with a shaker, a rag and cooking tools
      out of the box, and get spicy chemicals and a new toy when emagged.
  - rscdel: The service cyborg chef upgrade has been removed as it is now part of
      their standard loadout.
  - tweak: Service gripper can now pick up more things (basically everything the Rapid
      Service Fabricator can create, plus things needed in the kitchen). The gripper
      can now be directly synthesized to from the RSF.
  - tweak: The Rapid Service Fabricator no longer throws sparks all over the place
      when selecting what to fabricate. Instead it plays a clicking sound.
  jwhitak:
  - bugfix: Welding tools now properly attack the head while targetting the eyes and
      mouth, instead of doing nothing.

      the inside.'
  - bugfix: 'Wheelstation: removed some extraneous rad collectors and camera boards
      in engineering.'
  - tweak: 'Wheelstation: added masks and laser tag equipment to dorms, some more
      windows in medbay and around cargo, and one (1) coin.'
2023-11-09:
  brndd:
  - bugfix: 'Wheelstation: fixed missing turfs on supply shuttle'
2023-11-11:
  Eneocho:
  - bugfix: Maria's Hive (The Hivelord Queen) can now properly spawn in the asteroid.
  jwhitak:
  - tweak: Updated the Cargo Computers to have cleaner UIs.

      forwards waiting to be processed.
  - rscadd: The call shuttle button is replaced with a timer that updates when you

      fail or don't exist).
  - tweak: Renamed the existing permissions for better clarity,
  - tweak: Bulk ordering crate popups are auto-selected and default to 0 crates.
  - tweak: Moves Vox/Plasmaman suit crates back to Clothes, adds N2/Plasma Internals
      crates to Supplies
  - tweak: Removes the Camera set out of the Arts and Crafts crate and puts it into
      a new Photography crate.
  - tweak: Grass now comes in a temperature controlled crate.
  - bugfix: Fixed a helper proc called _asc that sorted in descending order (and vice
      versa)...

  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - rscadd: Castle Station has been modernized and will look far more like current
      Box Station. Notably, the Head of Personnel now has the Labor Administration
      Console as well as the photo booth, the Fore (northern) maintenance tunnels
      are larger, the Pod Bay has been moved, all the wires are now yellow and insulated
      gloves will once again have a semi-randomized position.
  - rscadd: Replaced Castle Station's beach jukebox with a super jukebox.

      on Castle Station with Security and Silicon jobs.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where high preferences for jobs that were not currently in
      the round would still appear on Manifest Prediction. This was most notable on
      Castle Station with Security and Silicons.
  - tweak: Assistants will no longer be limited if Security roles are disabled. This
      notably allows unlimited assistants on Castle Station.
  brndd:
  - rscadd: Added plushies and a claw machine to get them from. The claw machine can
      be found in the dormitories of most maps, except RoidStation where it's in the
      bar. It exchanges credits for regular plushies and coins for special plushies.
      Plushies can be hugged by attacking someone (including yourself) with one on
      help intent, and can have their stuffing removed with a sharp tool and replaced
      with a grenade.
  - bugfix: 'Wheelstation: fixed missing cargo crate weigher, broken cargo shuttle
      conveyor, wrong access on outpost NanoMed, backwards ore unloader on mining
      outpost.'
  - tweak: 'Wheelstation: added some more lights in maint and replaced the mini-mining
      outpost NanoMed with a wall-mounted one.'
  nervere:

      version.

      etc.

2023-11-25:
  DorainGrey:
  - bugfix: Fixed many many bugs on Horizon from first playtest.
2023-11-26:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Dynamic mode now resets Extended's incremental weight if a round ended
      with not a single ruleset executed (aka, de-facto Extended). These types of
      round would occur naturally on low threat, and since they wouldn't reset Extended's
      threat level it would instead increase and have even more chance to occur on
      the next round even if it had a higher threat level.
  DorainGrey:
  - tweak: Even more Horizon bug fixes
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: The RAM cost for Redundant Threading, Brightness Enhancer and Remote Signaler
      is now 10 (instead of 15).
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: Punctualite, a ghetto chemistry made chemical that explodes at the turn
      of the hour.

  - tweak: Extra fluff on the drug lab vault.
  - bugfix: The Laundromat should now properly spawn (I think).
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Being in your body as a ghost will now properly show messages as if you
      are a ghost instead of almost hearing something every time.

      before starting the game.

  boy2mantwicethefam:

      or injection rather than just compatible blood types.
  brndd:
  - tweak: 'Wheelstation: telecomms cooling should work faster now'

      the Ape faction/role was assigned to players.

      bussing purposes. Find it in the "Fun Secrets" part of the Secrets Panel.

      Using them to reinforce girders will result in the classic gold and silver walls.

  DorainGrey:
  - bugfix: Escape Pod Emagging does not break Horizon Shuttle
2023-12-08:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: Implemented a new subsystem that revamps the way reagent containers
      normalize their temperature in relation to the environment. This new method
      makes reagents reach room temperature quite faster on average (except when using
      a Stasis Beaker), and has been finely adjusted so temperature changes are more
      noticeable while also feeling realistic. You can Alt Middle click a beaker or
      food item to blow some air on them and accelerate the process. As an added bonus,
      this system consumes a negligible amount of CPU compared to the one in effect
      until now, and is much simpler to read and adjust, thus more maintainable.
  - experiment: The thermal dissipation subsystem has been disabled
  DorainGrey:
  - bugfix: Fixes Horizon ERT, Nuke Squads and death squads.

      more consistent; tweaked some of its probabilities.

      hitsound for mobs instead.
2023-12-10:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: The Paint & Linen Update is here! A world of acrylic, fabric, and
      glue opens before you.
  - experiment: 'Detailed changelog here: `https://github.com/vgstation-coders/vgstation13/pull/35451`'
  - rscadd: Reworked from scratch how paint mixes and interact with floors, walls,
      and everything in general. You can craft acrylic paint in Chemistry by first
      mixing glue, and then adding some pigments.
  - rscadd: Glue is a new (previously unused) reagent that applies to object the same
      effect that school glue applies, but for only a minute. Can be washed off with
      water. Creates splatters on the floor that slow down mobs.
  - rscadd: You can use Paint Rollers from Art Vendors to paint floors and walls without
      consuming reagents, and painting only parts of a tile.
  - rscadd: Paint Remover has been reworked into Acetone, and can be obtained either
      from the Art Vendor, or brewed in Chemistry.
  - rscadd: 'Added a new Vox Trader bundle: the Nano Painter''s toolbox. Nano Paint
      when applied over a whole tile will cause it to emit its own light. When used
      on canvas the parts painted with it will glow in the dark.'
  - rscadd: Nano Paint may also be crafted in Xenobiology by adding Phazon to a Pyrite
      Slime.
  - rscadd: Added a new Botany plant, Flax, whose product can be either grinded for
      Flax Oil which is a type of paint that partially matches the color of its surrounding
      reagents (pouring the mixture between two beakers a few times will cause the
      flax oil to match the other reagents' color completely). Flax may also be processed
      into cloth using either a Spinning Wheel crafted out of Wood, or an Electric
      Loom produced by R&D.
  - rscadd: Cloth can now be used to craft some simple items by hand, or more intricate
      clothing by using Knitting Needles crafted out of wood, or a Sewing Machine
      produced by R&D.
  - rscadd: After adding some pigments inside a cauldron, you can dye crafted items
      in it either fully, or partially depending on the item. Bedsheets can be dyed
      as well.
  - rscadd: Using Knitting Needles or a Sewing Machine, you can toggle the appearance
      of bedsheets between their old plaid look and their new wider look.
  - rscadd: R&D may also now print the High Roller, a large paint roller that lets
      you easily and efficiently apply reagents over a large area. This applies to
      paint, but also bleach, acetone, lube, everything you can think of. If the reagent
      is a pigment, it will cover floors like paint does.
  - imageadd: Re-Sprited Painting Brushes, Palettes, Paint Buckets, and added in-hand
      icons for all.
  - rscadd: Metal Buckets similar to Paint Buckets can now be crafted from metal sheets.
  - tweak: the old Bucket is now called Plastic Bucket, and can be crafted from Plastic,
      or from the Biogenerator.
  - tweak: the Colorful Syndrome disease effect has been reworked, and now splatters
      the surroundings of the infected mob with paint instead of using chem smoke.
  - rscadd: You can now toggle hoods on mannequins or other players by using the stripping
      menu.
  - tweak: Some machines now automatically appear higher when built on top of tables,
      or when tables are placed below them, and return to their default offset when
      the table is removed or flipped.
2023-12-11:

      the ground.

      making disease a pain and a half to cure.
  boy2mantwicethefam:

2024-02-18:
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Traitors can now buy the Dirty Bomb Artillery Remote, a device that detonates
      a dirty bomb in orbit and causes a radstorm on-demand. This storm behaves as
      a regular radstorm, but will report the area the remote was used on upon notifying
      the crew.

  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added 3 microwaves to Snaxi. One in the Escape hallway, one in front of
      Medbay, and one in front of the Bar. Crew-members can use those to warm up their
      food items after coming out of a snow storm. (The food items would reach room
      temperature quickly on their own anyway, but this is a pretty pro-immulsions
      way to do it)
  RealestEstate:
  - rscadd: PAI can uninstall software to make room for others. The process takes
      some time and must complete before the RAM can be refunded.
  - imageadd: The once available dark purple and dark green hoodies are back in stock
      again

  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added the Soulblade Sanctum vault
  - tweak: Food and reagents in your hands and backpack no longer freeze while in
      space. They may be allowed to freeze by dropping them directly onto a space
      turf still. In more general terms, held items and ones in containers now experience
      reduced or no entropy in low pressure environments.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: The Phazon-Nothing reaction now costs 1u of phazon and 1u of Nothing to
      make, and gives 5u of reagent in return. It now requires 5u of Mutagen and 5u
      of Enzyme as catalysts instead of 10 of each.
  - rscadd: Spessmen might find themselves affected by Lime Disease, and are advised
      to procure some salt and tequila in that case.

  - rscdel: 'Blob: Blobs can no longer appear at roundstart.'
  - rscadd: 'Blob: Manual blob expansion no longer has a 75% chance to fail when expanding
      into space, which would waste the chemicals in the process.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Midround blobs now produce twice as many chemicals per second (2
      -> 4).'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Manual blob expansion now costs 5 chemicals instead of 15.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Blobs now deal 50% brute damage and 50% burn damage when attacking.
      Stock up on that burn medication, and diona beware!'
  - rscadd: 'Blob: Blobs will now ignore half of a target''s armor value when calculating
      damage. Some of the defensive values would lead to absurd amounts of protection
      against the blob.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Strong blob tiles now have 50 health, down from 75, which means
      less hits are required to destroy them (3 Liberator/Antique Laser Gun shots,
      4 regular laser shots, down from 4 and 5-6 respectively).'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Blob tiles now have a 50% chance to successfully spread into space
      instead of 25%. Useful, as the midround blob comes from outer space.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Resource blobs now cost 10 points instead of 30 points, meaning
      they will make a return on their investment after 1 minute and 20 seconds at
      earliest instead of 4 minutes.'
  - tweak: 'Blob: Liberator laser gun shots will now deal 25 damage to blobs instead
      of 40, which is the default for anything that isn''t humanoid, and deal half
      of their damage to a nearby blob tile on hit, which means a Liberator shot can
      destroy a blob tile and damage another in one shot rather than destroy two blob
      tiles. Fire in a formation!'
  - rscadd: 'Blob: Midround blobs can now influence the round''s episode name.'
  - rscdel: Auto-ignition mechanics from air temperature has been disabled, and will
      now require previous conventional sources of being set on fire in order to be
      on fire.
  - rscdel: Items on fire will no longer produce temperatures by themselves. However,
      the fires they may produce, such as pie tins in contact with sparks, still will.

      that get transferred alongside regular wizard spells.
  - bugfix: Fixed an oversight where it was possible for a wizard to get points for
      the "No Gun Allowed" restriction multiple times, provided that he had extra
      spellbooks.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the "No Gun Allowed" restriction wasn't transferred
      when the wizard transformed into something else, meaning that they would be
      able to use guns.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where artifacts that could be purchased only one time could
      be repurchased again after buying the wizard's spellbook bundle or after summoning
      magic, which also fixes an exploit where it was possible to infinitely buy Summon
      Magic as long as the wizard bought No Gun Allowed after every cast.
  - bugfix: 'The "No Clothes" passive will no longer say it has "Range: 7", but instead
      "Range: Self".'

      update their sprites rather than after a short moment.
  - bugfix: Fixed a nearly 5 years old bug where Fireball could be used while pacified.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where it was impossible to buy Fireball after buying Fire
      Breath. Fire Breath is now its own independent spell, and the way the spellbook
      searches for known spells in a player's mind has been changed to fix the edge-case
      bug where buying a sub-type of a spell would prevent that spell from being purchased.
  - bugfix: Targeting someone directly with Pacify will now cast the spell at their
      location.
  - bugfix: Pacify can no longer be targeted at tiles that are not in the player's

      roles may appear during a round.

  - tweak: Midround rulesets will now roll more often.

      (vox and plasmamen) rather than applying a "paint job"
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: You can make sugar or salt cubes by microwaving 10u sugar/corn syrup or
      salt respectively.
  RealestEstate:
  - rscadd: Bioballistic Delivery System now has a multi-splice option which allows
      for multiple splices in one go. The time to complete the splice will scale proportionally
      with the number of splices so a large amount of splices will take longer to
      complete.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: The Magic Closet's other spells that bring the wizard to it or bring the
      closet to the wizard will no longer go on cooldown if the closet does not exist.

  - tweak: Wizards will now store Absorbed spells in their list of wizard spells.

      pitbulls (most of the time). In addition, their flavor text will now be properly
      removed.
  - bugfix: The Prestidigitation, Santa bundle and No Gun Allowed spells will now
      be properly considered wizard-specific spells when purchased from the spellbook.
  - bugfix: If wizard apprentices somehow manage to learn forbidden spellbook spells
      they will now be properly transferred during mind transference.
  - bugfix: Forbidden spellbook spells will now be properly blocked by gentling.
  - bugfix: Fixed a rare bug where the "Push" spell would fail to push a target if
      the area it selected did not have any tiles, which would only happen if the
      area existed at some point during the game but then stopped existing.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Mutate spell immediately ending early if the wizard had the
      Hulk gene.
  - bugfix: Hulk Out, Mutate and Become Highlander can no longer be stacked. Not that
      it did anything useful but it breaks things. Also added different messages for
      each ability when attempting to do so.
  - bugfix: Wizards and Apprentices will now display their current wizardly spells
      at the round-end scoreboard rather than every single spell and spell-like ability
      they know.
  - bugfix: Attempting to use Mind Transfer on a target that is already preparing
      to cast a spell (AKA in the state where they have to click something to cast
      the spell) should no longer break Mind Transfer so hard that it creates a living
      dummy being.
  - bugfix: Fixed a runtime in regards to wizard spells from wizard antagonists being
      transferred to a new character, such as through Mind Transfer or the Staff of
      Change.
