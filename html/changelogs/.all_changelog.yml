      the paper in your hand and clicking it with bite and help intent on.
  - tweak: Skellingtons no longer have lips.
2020-08-23:
  Exxion:
  - bugfix: Oxyloss from suffocation is now proportional to how much gas you needed
      but did not get, instead of proportional to how much gas you DID get. In comparison
      to the current behavior, this decreases suffocation damage when you have almost
      enough air, and increases it when you have much less than enough air.
  PaulRitter:
  - tweak: After passing another Bluespace Anomaly, Laser-reflection suddenly started
      working again. Huh, go figure.
  - tweak: Nanotrasen fitted their Laserguns with new internal processors. Report
      any inconsistencies
  ShiftyRail:
  - tweak: NRV Horizon will now actually consume fuel when travelling.

  9percents:
  - rscadd: There is a forensic labcoat inside detective's closet now. Lets you really
      get analytic.
  DamianX:
  - tweak: All players using a camera console will see its action buttons now, as
      opposed to only the last player to have interacted with it.
  - bugfix: Moving away from a camera console should properly reset the player's view.
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: You can no longer drag n drop stuff onto a cult altar with a complete
      disregard for where you or the stuff are standing, or whether you're even alive
      or dead.

  - rscadd: There's now a persistent top5 of richest escapes at the roundend scoreboard.
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: Alien Artifacts with a certain effect can now place random floortiles
      around themselves. Useful for sealing breaches or spicing up station flooring.
2020-08-28:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: Big Xenoarchaeology update!
  - imageadd: The depth scanner, digsite locators, core sampler, rock sliver, as well
      as the solution trays all have new sprites.
  - tweak: The core sampler now works without the need for sample bags, but takes
      one second to extract a sample. It's got sounds now too.
  - rscadd: You can use a pen on a rock sliver to label it.
  - rscadd: Edited the description of rock slivers, some of the xenoarch-related reagents,
      as well as the xenoarch sample analysis machines to help players understand
      each of their purposes.
  - tweak: Removed the beacon, and locater device from Excavation Tools closets due
      to their utmost uselessness in regard to the job. The locater (renamed locator)
      device however can now be acquired from the Protolathe at Bluespace Tech Level
      2. It still looks just like the disk pinpointer though.
  - tweak: The xenoarchaeological digsite locator has been buffed to always show digsite
      material colors (requires Anomaly Tech Level 3)
  - tweak: The advanced xenoarchaeological digsite locator has been buffed to also
      highlight turfs with buried large artifacts (requires Anomaly Tech Level 4)
  - rscadd: The Alden-Saraspova Counter is FINALLY available from RnD, barely 4 years
      after I added the fucking tech tree, and gives you the distance to the closest
      Large Artifact. You can also fit them in your excavation belt (requires Anomaly
      Tech Level 5)
  - rscadd: Added Hard Disk Drives. As useless as Corrupted Data Disks, and both may
      now be found in maint loot spawners
  - rscadd: Added Encrypted HDD (Anomaly Tech 5), now spawned by Anomaly Analysers
      when a large artifact gets analyzed for the first time. Replaces that anomaly
      tech data that used to be in the Anomaly Report. Deconstructing one of those
      is enough to get the advanced xenoarchaeological digsite locator which will
      highlight buried large artifacts.
  - tweak: The distance to the nearest artifact given by the Fourier transform spectroscope
      is a lot more reliable now that it counts distance in a circle rather than a
      square.
  - rscadd: You can slap Artifact Analysis reports onto Anomaly Containers, allowing
      people who examine the container to read the report.
  - tweak: Anomaly Containers are now access restricted to science. You can break
      them open still using an emag, guns, or explosions.
  - imageadd: Anomaly Containers have a slightly different appearance when containing
      a large artifact, or when broken.
  - tweak: Placing a Large Artifact into an anomaly container automatically toggles
      off its effects.
  - rscadd: Large Artifacts that have both been analyzed and had their primary effect
      activated at least once now add points to the crew score (wow, scientists can
      finally contribute to the crew score lol)
  - rscadd: You once again have a very small chance of finding a Syndicate Beacon
      instead of a Large Artifact in Xenoarch. You can use it to become a traitor,
      but the beacon will explode after a short delay if you were already part of
      another faction, or antag banned.
  - rscadd: Unlike the old Syndicate Beacon, it can be re-used, but subsequent traitorifications
      will require admin approval, so you'll be able to write a cover letter to the
      Syndicate for why they should hire you. If you bother admins too much, they
      will detonate the beacon.
  - imageadd: The Syndicate Beacon now has its own sprite that looks a bit like a
      laptop, separating it for good from the wish granter.
  - rscadd: Since I was confused at first between the Syndicate Beacon and the Singularity
      Beacon, I judged a good idea to have a regular non-syndicate Singularity Beacon
      spawn as well among the large finds. It has the same rarity as a large Supermatter
      Crystal, given its round-ending potential.
  - tweak: Upped the rarity of Construct Shells so they're more common than the round
      ending items.
  - bugfix: Fixed a few large artifacts such as the Warping Claws, the Essence Printer
      and the Communication Crystal being deemed mundane by the Anomaly Analyzer.
  - rscadd: A new edition of the Out on the Dig manual is out! Now with information
      actually relevant to the job of xenoarchaeology!
  - rscadd: Added a new item to the RD's locker. The Anomalous Energies Locator, which
      locates the closest currently activated Artifact or Anomaly Power Utilizer on
      the current Z Level. Something to help deal with rogue Xenoarchaeologists.
  - bugfix: Fixed large artifacts with a touch effect not visibly activating, or being
      logged.
  - rscadd: a single use Cult Pamphlet can now spawn instead of a large artifact,
      just like Vampire stone masks and Changeling vials. Same rarity too, which is
      to say, extremely low.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Core Sampler not ejecting the extracted sliver when clicked.
  GreatBigFailure:
  - tweak: Mind Machine's blacklist is now less cruel
  - rscadd: 'New Wizard Spell: Summon Snacks'
  - tweak: 'Diabeetusol V2: Full Fat'
  PaulRitter:
  - tweak: Lasers no longer freak out when hitting blobs

  Blithering:
  - imageadd: Updated stage 2 wendigo icon
  BurntDevil:
  - rscadd: Another cute MoMMI chassis shipped out. Please refrain from throwing floor
      tiles at it.
  gurfan:
  - tweak: Roulette revolvers can now be placed in buildable turrets.
  - rscadd: Headcrabs have finally snuck their way into the solar system. Thankfully,
      the station is still safe from them, at least for now.
2020-08-30:
  BurntDevil:
  - tweak: adjusted the hat and matched the movement state of the cutie mommi a bit
      for a better look
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Tweaked the ambience sounds of the Research Outpost. The Outpost Engineering/Atmos
      rooms now properly emit the same ambience as those on the station.
  - experiment: Here's a bunch of Xenoarch and Research Oupost fixes and tweaks
  - bugfix: Fixed analysis trays not having their sprite update when reagents are
      added or removed from them.
  - bugfix: Fixed the analysis machines only heating up when idle and not when scanning,
      regardless of the temperature of the air around them.
  - bugfix: Fixed the analysis machines heating up at an absurd rate. I removed the
      cap on entropy so cold air in the pen where the machines are is a lot more efficient
      at keeping them at working temperatures. The rate at which they heat up now
      depends on their power consumption which has been reworked for both their idle
      and active states.
  - experiment: This means however that the machines will overheat if you try to use
      them at room temperature. From now on when you arrive at the outpost and plan
      to do triangulation later, remember to turn on the Freezer so the pen has time
      to cool down. Upgrading the machines with phasic scanning modules or better
      however will let them complete the scan before they have time to overheat, so
      that's an alternative.
  - tweak: The temperature gauge on the machines now goes all the way from 0K to 400K.
  - tweak: Replaced the Nitrogen Pressure Tank with a Plasma Canister on top of a
      connector port on all maps (I used a Plasma Pressure Tank on maps where the
      canister couldn't be reached) which has much better specific heat and thus is
      much better at keeping the pen cold.
  - tweak: Removed the extra Air Alarm and vents in the Anomalous Materials Lab pen
      since it would always trigger alarms if you started cooling. Added a Gas Meter
      on the floor instead that can be examined from afar to check the pen's temperature.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Research Outpost Atmospherics' Gas Mixer taking 80 percent Oxygen
      and 20 percent Nitrogen instead of the other way around. It's been like that
      since forever? jesus christ.
  - tweak: Lots of small changes to the box Research Outpost beside the Anomalous
      Materials Lab. Removed one of the SMES, a single one is enough to keep the outpost
      powered for almost 4 hours, and extended the hallway with an airlock on the
      other side of the transit tube so you can easily set up the solars in the crate
      next to them, which have been found after testing to keep the outpost powered
      for up to 11 hours if set up early. Also added a Power Monitoring Computer to
      the Outpost Power Substation. Lots of other small QoL changes, moves items on
      tables a bit, added a Newscaster, a Mousecube box, added a pair of Suspension
      Field Gens to the Temporary storage for old times sake. Replaced the tables
      with the redundant pickaxe and excavation picks with crates that xenoarchaeologists
      can use to easily gather their small finds, along with a table on which can
      be found the new revamped Xenoarchaeology manual.
  - imageadd: Said manual, Out on the Dig New Edition! also features a new sprite.
  - tweak: The outposts of other maps have been tweaked a bit as well, but mostly
      just the Anomalous Materials Lab pen, and the new Out on the Dig manual.
  jknpj:
  - bugfix: Makes HonorABLE wizards less INVULNERable
2020-08-31:

  - bugfix: Fixes janitor disposals spewing trash into maint.
  - rscadd: Adds missing vents/scrubbers in dorms, the mech bay, and the science airlock.
  - rscadd: Adds a destination tagger on the cargo desk.
  - bugfix: Fixes a missing floor tile in the SME room.
  - bugfix: Fixes disposals dumping trash into research and development.
  - tweak: Replaces the hatches in the hall above science with glass airlocks.
  - tweak: Moves job-specific equipment from the shuttle dock of the research outpost
      to the access-locked portions, and removes the access requirement on the shuttle
      dock doors so that general population can reach the podbay. Adds an access requirement
      to the xenobotany airlock.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: Malfunctioning AIs can now hack faster the more APCs they've hacked, down
      to a limit of 10 seconds.

  Buchse:
  - tweak: sec uniforms doublechecked for fit.
  BurntDevil:
  - bugfix: Fixed a missing frame and misalignment on the cutie mommi.
  toomykins:
  - bugfix: fixed centcomm/security religious conversion!
2020-09-02:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Added the missing Security Cameras to RoidStation's anomaly isolation
      rooms.
  - bugfix: Turns that that ever since the Toxins Lab was moved to the Research Outpost
      on Box, the Long-Term Storage and Exotic Particle Collection rooms were disconnected
      from the powernet (and the latter also had their airlock erroneously named).
      This is no longer the case. Also Re-Added a few of the Biohazard and Radioactive
      signs that used to be next to those rooms' entrances.
  - tweak: Large Artifacts with touch activations can now activate not just when you
      bump into them, but when THEY bump into you.
  - tweak: Monkeys and other carbons can now touch large artifacts as well, until
      now it was just humans.
  - tweak: Anomaly power utilizers charged with effects activated by touch now check
      whether their holder is wearing gloves.
  - tweak: Anomaly power utilizers charged with effects activated by touch can be
      thrown at mobs once activated to have the effect trigger on them.
  - tweak: Anomaly power utilizers charged with effects activated by touch can be
      used to smack mobs to have the effect trigger on them (beware clumsy users though!)
  - rscadd: Added logging to anomaly power utilizers
  - tweak: Anomaly power batteries are now small items, and fit in pockets
  - rscadd: Anomaly power utilizers and their batteries can now be printed at R&D,
      at Anomaly Tech Level 4
  - rscadd: Added descriptions to anomaly power utilizers and their batteries.
  - imageadd: Added in-hand sprites to anomaly power utilizers and their batteries.
      The utilizers also appear visually different when active.
  - imageadd: Added new sprites, sounds and animations for Exotic Particle Harvesters.
  - tweak: Exotic Particle Harvesters will irradiate mobs in a small radius that doesn't
      go through walls while they are harvesting exotic particles. The anomaly suit's
      full radiation resistance will come in handy.
  gurfan:
  - tweak: The floortile artifact effect is less of an eyesore.
  - tweak: Cult and Ops won't fire without any security anymore.
2020-09-03:
  BurntDevil:
  - tweak: Random pixel corrected on magic closets.
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed a critical bug with the artifact projectiles effect that could potentially
      lag the server down to a crawl
  - tweak: When an artifact with the projectiles effect fires multiple shots, those
      are now staggered (a shot goes off every 0.5s)
  - tweak: Reduced the maximum charge delay on the artifact's projectile effect
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to use the interface of an anomaly power utilizer even
      while dead and not holding it.
  - bugfix: Fixed a runtime that prevents being able to activate artifacts with the
      pay2use trigger that rolled the 'bank card' mode.
  - bugfix: Hopefully fixed the Scanner Pads in the Anomalous Materials Lab and Exotic
      Particles Collection being invisible sometimes, and also being 1px too high
      when idle.
  - bugfix: Fixed Xenoarch bowls and urns having no name.
  - tweak: The cell charging and draining large artifact effects are a lot more potent
      now, both on silicons and on SMES (as opposed to barely having any effect like
      they do currently)
  - bugfix: Fixed admin-spawned large artifacts being invisible by default.
  - bugfix: You can no longer climb out of an inflatable shelter that you aren't even
      in!
  gurfan:
  - tweak: Energy weapons found in xenoarcheology will now have more varying statistics
      and attributes.
2020-09-05:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: 'Xenoarchaeology: Fixed several types of small finds never actually spawning
      an item when excavated. The affected finds were small crystals, instruments,
      statuettes, remains of humans xenos and robots, as well as a few unknown objects,
      all of which had been missing for who knows how long.'
  - tweak: Energy Walls that are produced by the Starscreen shield generators as well
      as some large alien artifacts now share the same explosion blocking properties
      that wizard Forcewalls have. Also making starscreen shield way better at actually
      protecting the station from asteroids.
  - rscadd: Anomaly Analysers can now analyze mobs as well, allowing them to analyze
      Robot Ducks.
  - rscadd: Anomaly Analysers will now produce non-mudane reports and encrypted HDDs
      when analysing Syndicate Beacons, Changeling Vials, Stone Masks and Cult Pamphlets.
  - soundadd: Most xenoarchaeology tools now make some sounds when being used.
  - bugfix: You now get visual and sound confirmation that you've hit a large artifact
      with an object.
  DrSnips:
  - rscadd: EMP and RAD shield modules are now available in game by means similar
      to existing hard suit modules.
  - tweak: Engineer and CE hard suits have undergone these changes.
  - rscadd: Both are equipped with a basic RAD module at round start
  - rscdel: Both have lost some (80 -> 50) rad armor as balance. This amount is similar
      to most "good" rad armor hard suits.
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: Headcrabs can now be spawned in the infestation event.
2020-09-08:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: 'Synergy: Moved the light fixture on top of the anomaly scanner pad in
      Anomalous Materials two tiles to the left.'
  - rscdel: Removed the Zombie Virus Syndrome virologist traitor item.
  - rscadd: Added the Deadly Syndrome Collection virologist traitor item, a diskette
      box filled with 3 random Deadly stage 4 syndromes GNA disks (the same syndrome
      won't show up twice) on top of a Waiting Syndrome GNA disk to help your disease
      spread undetected.
  - soundadd: Alien artifacts now emit a sound when their primary effect activates.
      Each artifact has their sound picked randomly amount 8 brand new sounds.
  - rscadd: Adds a new debug admin panel that tracks every large artifact in the world,
      whether they are excavated, buried, or destroyed.
  - rscadd: Re-added a Beacon to the Research Outpost on all maps ('cept Roid of course)
      to make up for those no longer in the Excavation lockers
  - bugfix: Fixed RoidStation's Anomalous Materials freezer facing South instead of
      North.
  - bugfix: Fixed Synergy's Anomalous Materials cold pen featuring a vent and a scrubber
      impeding the freezer's efforts at cooling the zone.
  GreatBigFailure:
  - bugfix: Pass the Pumpkin/Summon Snacks now work on laying targets
  Stressedphysicist:
  - tweak: Obesity and Fatness are now the same thing, being fat makes it harder to
      unfat
  - bugfix: The fat gene now makes you fat, removing it doesn't make you unfat
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: Wizards can now summon artifacts for the crew.
  - rscadd: Traders can now purchase dart guns and dart cartridges from their syndicate
      uplinks.

  - rscadd: NT switched coffee distributor, now coffee machines have more flavors.
  BomberBro:
  - rscadd: Adds donut burgers to your local kitchen
  DeityLink:
  - imageadd: Knives found in Xenoarch ancient battlefields now have a sprite fitting
      their name, instead of always looking like a kitchen knife.
  - tweak: Knives found in Xenoarch temple ruins are now ritual knives. They also
      have randomly generated engravings on them, and thus have an anomaly tech level
      of 2.
  - imageadd: Ritual knives finally have an in-hand sprite after all these years.
  - tweak: Xenoarch temple ruins can now feature both headgear and suits (headgears
      being 3 times more common than suits). There are 5 sets of increasing rarity
      to be found.
  abernd:
  - tweak: Nanotrasen-brand spiderbot interfaces are now compatible with mice.
  toomykins:
  - rscadd: malf and ion law'd AI's now have the option to audibly corrupt their VOX
      announcements.
2020-09-14:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed emitter beams not triggering artifact effects that are normally
      triggered by energetic interaction.
2020-09-16:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: After (probably more than) 7 years, bear traps are finally efficient at
      their purpose of disabling bears. Bears trapped in one will be pacified.
  - bugfix: Fixed the gib animations of animals such as carps and bears never playing.
  - bugfix: Fixed bear traps becoming glitched and unusable after a non-human walks
      over them.
  - bugfix: Fixed preassembled IEDs (pre-mapped) missing an underlay.
  - bugfix: Fixed players remaining stuck in place forever after walking into an IED-mounted
      bear trap
  - bugfix: Fixed the damage from forcefully removing bear traps only occuring if
      the bear trap was armed with an IED.
  - rscadd: Added a beartrap subtype with an IED already fit, and an armed version.
      For mappers.
  - rscadd: Bears caught by a bear trap armed with an IED will gib when the IED goes
      off.
  - rscadd: IEDs in bear traps may prime themselves when hit by explosions, leading
      to potential chain reactions.
2020-09-17:
  GreatBigFailure:
  - tweak: Wallets can now pickup cash with a click
2020-09-18:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: Centcomm Orders have been reworked and greatly expanded upon!
  - rscadd: Added a ton of new Centcomm Orders that can be shipped at Cargo. Three
      random orders are created at round start, more are created every 20 to 40 minutes
      depending on the population on the crew manifest. Departments with already active
      orders/no population are way less likely to receive new orders.
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has also just remembered that they really like plasma and that
      was the reason why the Space Stations were first built in that system. Shipping
      Plasma sheets in crates will add money directly to the Station funds. The order
      for plasma sheets is always available.
  - rscadd: Cargo receives a bonus payment of 10% of the fulfilled order's value every
      time an order for an other department gets fulfilled.
  - rscadd: Requested items can also be brought to the Emergency Shuttle instead of
      Cargo. They will be processed (but not deleted) when the shuttle reaches Centcom
      just as if they had been shipped through the Supply Shuttle (Requirements such
      as being in a crate or not still apply). Shipping items this way won't grant
      Cargo a bonus.
  - rscadd: Departments that may receive orders will appear on the round end scoreboard
      in a leaderboard. All that matters to rank up is the money on the department's
      account at round end. Any way to increase that number (or reduce the number
      of other departments) are fair game. Try to have your department reach rank
      1!
  - rscadd: When a Centcomm Order is created, the Request Consoles of the concerned
      departments will receive a message (wow those finally have a purpose?)
2020-09-19:
  toomykins:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen HR will automate any requests sent with the magnetic stamp
      again, and you can still fax any other paperwork to them too!
2020-09-20:
  gurfan:
  - tweak: Shunted AIs can use the VOX announcement system to taunt the crew, even
      after their original core was destroyed.
2020-09-22:
  Buchse:
  - rscadd: Vox tail-regen tech surges forwards.
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: Malfunctioning AIs will now get a screen alarm while hacking an APC.
  - bugfix: Fixed Malfunctioning AIs being stuck hacking forever if the target APC
      got destroyed.
  - tweak: The hack time for Malfunctioning AIs has been reverted to a flat 60 seconds.
  - rscadd: AI's can now swap between a cyborg shell and their main core!
  - rscadd: AI's can now create cyborg shells from completed cyborg skeletons that
      are visible to the AI. The AI can only have one shell at a time; the previous
      one must be destroyed before a new one can be made. The AI can gib their shell
      at any time using an action button. (Even while the shell is dead!)
  - rscadd: AI-Cyborg Shells have a unique title on the radio and a white glow to
      their eyes, unlike normal cyborgs. When emagged, they will gib instead of receiving
      a syndicate lawset.
  - rscadd: Completed cyborg exoskeletons can be touched with an empty hand to prevent/allow
      the AI to turn it into a shell.
  - rscadd: Cyborg exoskeletons can now be smashed apart with anything as strong as
      a toolbox. Doing so will destroy the exoskeleton but drop any attached parts
      (arms, legs, torso, head) on the ground. It will also make a good mess for the
      janitor to clean up.
  - tweak: Dead silicons will improve the crew score instead of penalizing it when
      there's a Malfunctioning AI.
2020-09-23:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Cargo not getting monetary contribution for "per unit" orders, such
      as plasma shipments to Centcom.
  - tweak: Fixed Chaplain not having a set wage amount. It has been fixed to 35.
  - tweak: Raised Virologist wage from 45 to 55, same as geneticist and paramedic,
      since they interact a lot more with the crew since the rework.
  - tweak: Raised Department wages from 50 to 100.
  - tweak: Reworked the way wages are processed. Salaries are now drawn directly from
      the station funds, with Nanotrasen then recharging it for the next payroll based
      on the default salaries (with an additional recharge before the payroll to take
      latejoiners into account), with an overhead of 10%. Effectively, that means
