  jellyveggie2:
  - tweak: The power grid now works off a priority system. Consumers in higher priority
      tiers receive power before those on lower tiers. All consumers in the same tier
      receive the same amount of power proportional to how much each requested and
      how much power is left available for said tier.
  - tweak: 'Current priority round-start is: Emitters > APCs and machinery > Recharging
      an APC > recharging an SMES. So, the SMES won''t recharge until there''s enough
      power for all APCs to recharge, and APCs won''t recharge until there''s enough
      power to run'
  - tweak: Emitters can run at low power so long as you can meet at least 30% of their
      demand, albeit with reduced intensity. Intensity scales linearly with met demand,
      so 50% met demand means 50% intensity.

      the station requires in that moment, rather than how much it is consuming'

      you have engineering access. Feel free to redirect power from security to cargo
      or whatever.

      them within the power monitor.
