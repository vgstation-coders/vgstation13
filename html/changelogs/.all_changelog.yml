      a new hive if there are no empty apiaries available.

      eventually grow tired/bored, and go home. Or start roaming if they don't have
      one.
  MadmanMartian:
  - rscadd: Adds the rig modification station. Orderable from cargo, lets you install
      rig modules into your rigsuit
  - rscadd: Adds the articulated spine rig module. Lets you examine the users rigsuit

      the HoP's office!
  - rscadd: The PDA station map app has been revamped to work just like a portable
      station holomap. It still gives your coordinates when used, but you may no longer
      place markers on it, but frankly until there is a significant demand for it
      I'll bury that feature. On the bright side this means it now works on all maps
      and automatically updates with all map changes.

  - tweak: Some religions now start with different incenses.

  - rscadd: Adds 2 new stage 2 symptom for pathogens. One makes you burn calories
      quicker, the other makes you burn them slower.
  - rscadd: Adds the Ice Barrage spell. Freezes the target in a block of ice for 10

  - tweak: Denser mining turfs are now much more resistant to explosives

  - rscadd: Since most of the giant spiders were exterminated, carp have begun to
      nest more freely among the 'roids. Crew are advised to be more cautious of deep

      damsel in distress?
  - rscadd: Added waifu and secfu corpses which other mappers may find useful.
  Kurfursten:

  - tweak: Blobstorms are now much cheaper, require less extreme conditions to fire,
      and get a fake meteor warning at first (as well as more delay before announcing
      it was a blobstorm after all); roundstart blobs remain the same

      added

  boy2mantwicethefam:

      due to the multiplier for the time it takes to build objects being 0.

      multiplier in order to have clean-looking costs due to unintended interaction
      of level 1 default research in the multiplier calculation.

      nothing, but now it will make you regenerate twice as fast but make you go hungry

      indicator disappears once the stun is over, or the victim dead.

      It has to be the real deal vodka ala tunguska triple distilled, not derivatives
      or knock-offs!

      to blow up instead of reducing the explosion!
2019-03-05:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that let a crew-member that refused conversion be designed
      as sacrifice target the instant before they get devoured.

      may now force a re-roll at an altar by communing with Nar-Sie if the target
      either had their body destroyed, or fled the station's Z level. This means that
      the cult may now confirm that their target is still around the station.
  - tweak: Added a bunch of flavor text when progressing to Act 1 or getting converted
      to remind cultists how to summon their own Arcane Tome.

      magic wand like a wizard staff or null rod to make a rabbit appear.
  - rscadd: Added rabbits. They don't do or say much other than look cute.
  Exxion:
  - bugfix: Fixed two ancient bugs that caused fires to burn hotter and release more
      CO2 than intended. Fires in general are now much colder and produce much, much
      less pressure. This affects bombs as well. Since six years of balance happened
      since these bugs were introduced, some numbers are probably going to have to
      be tweaked.
  SirSkeleto:
  - rscadd: Harm attacking a cablecuffed spaceman will NO LONGER break the cablecuffs,
      and instead stab the target.
  boy2mantwicethefam:

      against foes that are armed and against which you should _really_ tase first,
      and ask questions later. Sprites courtesy of @otatoh."'
2019-03-09:
  Exxion:
  - tweak: Almost doubled energy released per mole of reactant in fires, again. This
      should bring bombs and burn chambers back to roughly where they were before,
      or only slightly lower. This also affects all other fires, but any time the
      ratio of reactants to total gas is low, they'll still be far weaker than before.
      (If you see this message but don't observe the effects in-game, blame whoever
      merged the PR)
  Irradiation:
  - tweak: Malfunctioning AIs can now occur dynamically midround with incredibly low
      odds. Dead/Low Lowpop can't roll midround MALF.
  MadmanMartian:

      it removes the lockdown upon death.

      will cause the next round on that map to be shiny and clean.
  - rscadd: Janitors get one extra cleaning grenade in each janitor closet (room)
      per 100 gunk tiles from the previous round
2019-03-11:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Roundstart ruleset weights have been adjusted. Overall there will be more
      traitors, less nuke ops and malf.
  - tweak: High danger (potentially round ending) roles have had their ruleset costs
      increased, which lowers the chance of them happening at the same time.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused two roundstart rulesets to proc at population
      levels that should never allow it.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixes the Sith bundle Sith Lightning appearing in the wizard's spellbook
      instead of the normal Lightning. Sith Lightning is weaker than normal Lightning

  - rscadd: Adds descriptions to the symptoms of viruses. These are viewable through
      analysis of the virus.

      civilization. Xenoarchs are recommended to look for parts that are compatible
      with current machinery.

  - tweak: Using a communicate rune mid-cast will allow you to write a "Cult reminder",
      which will be engraved in the memory of all present cultists and all new converts.

  MadmanMartian:

      lockdown will ACTUALLY be lifted.

      select Skellington, and Engineering staff may select AME.
  - rscadd: Ninja gloves now drain anything with a cell (incl tasers, eguns, cyborgs,
      mechas). If they are on cooldown or the target has less than 100 charge, you
      will interact with the target normally. Feel free to headpat that unpowered
      borg.
  - rscadd: Wearing ninja gloves renders you untrackable by an AI.

      them.
  - bugfix: Summon guns once again gives guns to all
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug in which the Donutgiver could only be swapped on

      faster.

2019-03-23:
  DeityLink:

      have granted janitors the ability to understand the speech of mice and rats.
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: A bunch of broken religion keys, like science, now work
  - rscadd: Objectives can now exist as a delayed type where the target is chosen
      later. Assassinate is delayed 10 minutes for most antags (but not for revolutionaries).

  - experiment: As our player numbers have soared in the past week, Dynamic Mode which
      had been designed to support populations oscillating between 5 and 50 players
      has basically kept picking mode as if we were being permanently at Threat Level
      100, as far as roundstart rulesets are concerned at least. Therefore a new alternative
      configuration has been put in place that puts more weight on the Threat Level,
      and less on the player population, with the goal to bring back some variety
      to our rounds, and less Nuke+Malf+Blob at every or so roundstarts.

      one loaded) and earmuffs + thermals
  - tweak: Family name has been updated so you can leave it blank to allow your teammates
      to random name instead of fixing a name if you don't have a good imagination
      or don't care to pull a family gimmick. You can also set your own title instead
      of having one picked for you (literally anything you can type within the normal
      character limit, or none for STELT)
  - tweak: Nuclear Operatives Cyborg cost reduced from 100 to 60. Syndicate Mech cost
      reduced from 140 to 80. Syndicate Bomb cost reduced from 100 to 25. As a reminder,

  - tweak: Syndicate Bombs brought from 1, 3, 7 back to their 3, 7, 14 glory. You
      have to spend TCs to get them now, so it's better they don't explode like a
      wet fart
  - tweak: Changed grenade launcher code to actually prime the grenade properly and
      respect the inbuilt timer instead of a fixed 1.5 seconds timer. Also solves
      insivible grenades issue

  - tweak: you can now wrench libray checkout computers to move them
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: Several stuns have been reduced. Electrode, ebow, shotgun electrode bolt,
      lube, and clown PDA last 10 seconds, weapons that use "weak bullets" like the
      mech AC, certain shotguns, and water slips last 6 seconds. Plasma guns had their
      stun chance removed, and they can no longer stun.
2019-06-18:
  I-VAPE-VOX-CLOACA-EVERY-DAY-OF-MY-LIFE:
  - rscdel: Disabled persistence for blood, gibs, and tracks. Other cleanable decals

  - rscadd: Massive increased RPG projectile speed because it's a rocket, you know
  - rscadd: Meteors will now head for the general center of the station, instead of
      some random location which previously meant that a good half to two thirds will
      miss wide. You can thank me later for the Meteors rounds.
  - tweak: Boxstation map changes. Heavily reworked the new Arrivals northern maintenance.
      E.V.A maintenance access was worked back in between Solars and Ghetto Bar. Most
      of the lights were removed to stay in tune with other maintenances. A lot of
      clutter that got in the way of actually moving down maintenance was moved or
      culled (both this one and others). The ragecage no longer has 20 blockers including
      multiple view occluders inside it. Access to Security Hallway was removed in
      favor of re-adding the window bay
  - tweak: Slight tweak to other maintenances on Boxstation to streamline movement,
      align some doors and generally make it -feel- nice. Also the Auxilliary Cyborg
      Charger window is now shocked, so, you know, don't space it hoping to get free
      insulated gloves, learn how to hack a fucking door

      mommis)
  - rscadd: Cutting or pulsing an airlocks wires now makes a sound
  - rscadd: Did metaclub stuff!
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: The values of minerals at the smelter have been dramatically reduced. Mining

  - tweak: Malf AI's weight has been increased, making it more likely to roll at roundstart.
2019-07-05:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Players sacrificed with an empty soul blade are now properly converted.
  - rscadd: Clicking on an empty soda can with HARM intent on will crush the can in
      your hand, making a satisfying sound. Crushed cans are considered a trash item
      so they will persist between rounds. They can no longer be cut with wirecutters
      or used to hold reagents, however they can still be ground into aluminum using
      a mortar, or fed to an auto-lathe for a bit of iron.
  - rscadd: Crushed cans deal 2 brute damage instead of one when thrown, and can be
      thrown slightly further and faster that regular cans.
  SonixApache:

2019-07-08:
  DamianX:
  - tweak: Freedom implants will always have 5 uses, whereas previously they could
      have a random amount between 1 and 5.
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Pale beings in crit now have an overlay applied to them, indicating to
      everyone that they're in crit. As a reminder, even though they don't fall unconscious,
      they still take periodic oxygen damage.
  - tweak: Pale beings in crit now take 1 brute damage per second. Unlike oxygen damage,
      they cannot just heal it through fervor by themselves.
  - tweak: Pale beings now die at -50 hp instead of -100 hp. This means that a fully
      charged egun can take an armored pale body down if every shot connects, without
      having to rely on crit damage over time to finish the job.
  DrSnips:
  - rscadd: Detectives now have a belt that can carry most of the gear from their
      locker and other job related items such as fingerprint cards. Also added a spray
      bottle of luminol, switchblade, and sec tape to their gear box.

      dangerous area possible.
  - tweak: Your Dreamseeker window will now flash orange if you are given an admin
      PM or if a gamemode is looking for candidates.
2019-07-09:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: Viro has been completely rewritten! The implications are huge so I'll
      try to organize the changelog with information relevant to most players at the
      top.
  - rscadd: All medbays now feature a bookcase full of medical manuals, including
      the brand new Virology guide, and an Encyclopedia of all disease symptoms. This
      Encyclopedia automatically updates itself as new symptoms are added in the code.
  - rscadd: For the time being Virologists will spawn holding the new Virology guide
      manual, this manual may also be found in Virology itself. If you play Virologist,
      give it a read. If you just want to know how to cure diseases in the heat of
      the moment, the first chapter is a step by step crash course for you.
  - rscadd: You may now use an Health Analyser on any living being to check whether
      they are carrying some pathogen.
  - rscadd: New players have a 10% chance of spawning with a weak and mostly harmless
      disease. Those can be easily cured with 5u spaceacillin.
  - rscadd: Mice that spawn in maint have a 20% chance of carrying a disease. Said
      disease is never airborne, but is notably more dangerous than those that humans
      can spawn with.
  - rscadd: Minor and Major viral outbreaks have been reworked. Both will instantly
      infect 10% of the station's crew with the same pathogen, so if an individual
      is cure, it'll be relatively easy to cure the rest. Major outbreaks however
      are likely to carry dangerous pathogen.
  - rscadd: Poisoned Syndi meat pizza has been "fixed". It previously spawned filled
      with infected AB+ blood, which means that only crewmembers of AB+ blood type
      could actually get infected.
  - rscadd: When getting attacked by blob or blob spores, you may get infected with
      a new type of pathogen that's single stage and doesn't do anything on its own.
      If you die while infected, you'll spawn some blob tiles around you. The longer
      you've been infected, the more tiles you'll spawn, even spawning a node after
      5 minutes. Blob spores that die also leave a pathogenic cloud behind them, so
      be sure to wear a hardsuit or some sterile equipment when fighting the blob
      up close, and get checked at medbay after the threat has been dealt with. This
      symptom may be exploited to created blob walls of specific shape.
  - rscadd: Loose Catbeasts that arrive on the station are carriers of not one but
      TWO dangerous diseases! Be careful when hunting them down. As the catbeast yourself,
      you may try to acquire and drink some milk and some water to cause your diseases
      to progress faster.
  - rscadd: Added a new midround ruleset that may proc if there are at least two Medical
      Doctors, or CMO, or Virologist. Plague Mice Invasion. A group of 1 to 5 mice
      infected with a dangerous Bacteria appear on the station and try to spread their
      disease to as many mobs as possible while the crew tries to stomp them and cure
      their disease. Enable Minor Roles to be allowed for candidacy.
  - rscadd: Urn and Bowls found in Xenoarchaeology now have a chance of containing
      some blood infected with a disease. Such diseases tend to have generally helpful
      symptoms.
  - rscadd: Large Xenoarchaeolgy artifacts have a new potential effect that causes
      them to release pathogenic clouds carrying a disease of random dangerosity.
  - rscadd: Given admins some tools to easily create highly customized diseases, essentially
      letting them control every aspect of the disease and its effects. They may even
      give the disease up to 100 stages but then setting up each stage might becomes
      a chore. Said disease may be inoculated inside a mob, or spawned inside a growth
      dish.
  - rscadd: Admins also now have a panel that displays every disease currently in
      the world and where they came from, who's infected by it, what items are infected
      by it, which growth dish contains them, and whether they're in the database
      or not (which admins can actually toggle).
  - rscadd: Growth dishes now have their appearance depend on the disease in them.
      with a random color and a random pattern of a random color. Major mutations
      may cause a variation in color.
  - rscadd: The Pathogen database now lists mutated pathogen as children of the original
      pathogen, making archiving sensibly easier. Pathogen may also now be given a
      nickname instead of a name. Said nickname will appear when the disease is analyzed
      in a mob or on the Medical HUD. You may also change the disease's dangerosity
      from Undetermined to Safe or Dangerous, which will change the appearance of
      the Status icon that appears on the Medical HUD.
  - rscadd: If wearing a Medical PDA with its health scanner activated, the PDA will
      tell its owner if they suddenly got infected with a disease.
  - rscadd: Wizarditis has been ported to virus2 at long last, and has been reworked
      to be more !!fun!!. After being infected for a while, you will start shouting
      random spells, but unlike the old version, each spell you randomly shout will
      actually be cast! Thankfully the proc chance is reasonably low.
  - rscadd: All symptoms now have a Danger value that ranges like so. 0 for helpful.
      1 for flavor text. 2 for annoying. 3 for hindrance. 4 for harmful. 5 for deadly.
  - rscadd: Diseases may incubate inside irradiated mobs, and should they also have
      mutagen in their system, they may induce an effect mutation. However effects
      mutating this way will only switch to an effect of similar Danger.
  - rscadd: Chemistry secure lockers now contain a box of vials, allowing them to
      preserve blood samples from infected patients and transmit them to Virology.
  - rscadd: All bio suit lockers now also contain a pair of Science Goggles. These
      can now be turned on to let their wearer easily find airborne pathogenic clouds,
      items and mobs infected with contact pathogen, and floor splatters that contain
      pathogen as well.
  - rscadd: Tech Storages on all maps have a new rack containing spare circuitboards
      for all virology machines.
  - rscadd: Toxin Firstaid Kits have had one of their Anti-Toxin syringes replaced
      with a Spaceacillin syringe.
  - rscadd: ERTs now have a box of vials and two pill boxes of nanofloxacin at their
      HQ, as well as a centrifuge on their shuttle, and two more science goggles in
      their back room, allowing them to efficiently deal with epidemics.
  - rscadd: Rewritten the ways diseases can transmit both by contact and through the
      air. A disease may have one or several spread vectors, allowing it to spread
      both by contact or through the air. This also opens the door for new exotic
      spread vectors down the line.
  - rscadd: Diseases with the contact spread vector may also temporarily contaminate
      items. Higher infectability means it lingers on the item for a longer time.
      Infected items can simply be washed at a sink, washing machine, or sprayed with
      Space Cleaner to remove the pathogen.
  - rscadd: All items (and most importantly, clothing) have a sterility variable that
      indicates their chance to not get infected (or protect their wearer from infection).
  - rscadd: The antibody scanner has been reworked and is now called the immunity
      scanner. It can be used on any item to get their sterility value, or any living
      mob to get an analysis of their immune system.
  - rscadd: When touching or hitting someone, the checks for infection are done depending
      on which body part enters in contact. (for example, when shaking hands, both
      hands are checked, but when patting a head, your hands are checked along with
      the head being patted. Only one side has to succeed in a sterility check to
      prevent infection).
  - rscadd: Similar checks are performed when a mob bumps into another mob. When bumping
      into someone, you hands are checked against the other's torso. However if bumping
      into a tiny mob, such as a mouse, your feet are the ones checked.
  - rscadd: Due to how items can get infected if they aren't sterile, keep that in
      mind when hitting someone or performing surgery. Science goggles can easily
      reveal infected items.
  - rscadd: Pathogen that can only spread through blood may still spread through contact
      if both parts checked are bleeding.
  - rscadd: Also, blood that's been infected with pathogen that spreads through contact
      may also infect individuals by being splashed upon them.
  - rscadd: Sterilizine can now be sprayed over items to increase their sterility
      permanently by 30 points.
  - rscadd: Airborne pathogen no longer spread instantly to adjacent mobs. Instead
      whenever a mob infected with an airborne pathogen breathes with its mouth unobstructed
      and unfiltered, they release a pathogenic cloud that contains all their airborne
      diseases, and that moves accross the room, further the higher the pathogen's
      infectability variable is. Another mob may then get infected if they are close
      to such a cloud when they breath themselves. Mobs breath every 8 seconds on
      average, and clouds linger for about 10 seconds. Pathogenic clouds do NOT spread
      through vents, for now at least.
  - rscadd: Monkeys now have Status and Health bars displayed on the Medical HUD.
      Mice have their Status icon displayed as well.
  - rscadd: The monkey-sized doctor clothing fully protects its wearer from contracting
      or spreading diseases.
  - rscadd: All mice may get infected just as easily as human and monkey, and most
      symptoms will work on them as well.
  - rscadd: You may now use an empty syringe on a mice to draw 5u of blood, inflicting
      them 5 oxy damage.
  - rscadd: Added small critter cages. Can be crafted with a bit of Plasteel, and
      placed on a table or on the floor. You can pick up mice by drag n dropping them
      on yourself with Grab intent, and then place them inside those cages. You can
      then pick up the cage by drag n dropping it onto yourself.
  - rscadd: Mice in cages may not contract or spread diseases, unless they get pet
      through the cage.
  - rscadd: You may add some reagents to the cage, which will cause the mice in them
      to start gulping them up. You may also add some food on top of the cage to feed
      the mice in it.
  - rscadd: Mice now have a chewing animation which they play whenever they eat or
      they chew cables.
  - rscadd: Player-controlled mice may click on mobs to nibble their toes, which may
      cause contact diseases to spread if contact can be made. If the mob is lying
      down, they may also try to nibble fingers or ear lobes.
  - rscadd: Virology now features its own pet mice, of the Balb/c strain. Its name
      is randomized, but it'll keep company to people in Virology. Don't forget to
      feed them!
  - rscadd: Oh right and Virology itself works a lot differently, like, just read
      the in-game Crash Course in Virology manual, Virologists spawn with it and it
      can be found in both Medbay's bookcase and Virology itself. All machines have
      been reworked and mutating and curing diseases is also a bit different so just
      go read that. It'd really be too long for a changelog.
  - rscadd: If you play Medbay YOU SHOULD READ THAT. Or at least the first chapter.
  - rscadd: Antigen now have rarity. Weak diseases tend to have more easily aquired
      antigen, while more dangerous diseases have antigen that are harder to obtain
      before an outbreak.
  - rscadd: Medbots now detect diseases that are in the database in individuals, and
      try to inject them with spaceacillin. They may no longer detect old diseases
      but they didn't do much to help with those anyway.
  - rscadd: The green old sadface status icon is still used to indicate individual
      infected with old diseases, such as appendicitis.
  - rscadd: Added a Laboratory Mice supply pack to cargo, containing some small cages
      and also mousecubes. Yeah those are a thing now.
  - rscadd: All mice now lose half less nutrition by moving and standing, and gain
      twice more by eating.
  Kharkov72:
  - rscadd: Adds the fat religion.
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: Soul Ramblers can now show up in any population, but prefer to ramble in
      lowpop shifts.
  - rscdel: The Proto-Kinetic Accelerator is no longer purchased at the mining vendor
      ($300)
  - rscadd: A PKA warp voucher can be bought at the mining vendor ($25). This turns
      into a PKA when brought into the mine.
  - tweak: Sending plasma back to centcomm on the supply shuttle now pays out 5x as
      much, for a total of 10x (it originally paid 2x value).
  MadmanMartian:
  - rscadd: Cyborg chargers now accept anyone that has a cell to them, not just silicons.
  - tweak: The cyborg charger now draws energy from the grid properly.
  SonixApache:
  - bugfix: Ninjas can now teleport again
  - tweak: Handgun holsters can now hold bananas.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where calculated armor could reach values below 0, making
      damage sources deal even more damage than intended, such as a ninja sword that
      dealt approx. 90 damage per hit on an unarmored target.
  - soundadd: Geiger counter now plays a sound when it detects radiation.

  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: The round end scoreboard will now add and remove points from the crew
      score based on how many beneficial or harmful diseases are loose in living mobs.
  - tweak: Plague Mice Invasion event only considers mobs as "still infected" on the
      round end scoreboard if they're still alive.
  - bugfix: maybe fixed a bug that caused medical HUDs to display the ill status even
      though the disease hasn't been added to the database.
  - rscadd: humans turning into zombies upon death keep their diseases, which may
      then transmit to their meat. (zombies themselves can't spread their diseases
      for now, more to that later)
  - rscadd: mice in small cages get a similar buff to antipathogenic efficiency that
      other mobs get when they rest in a bed.
  - rscadd: Admin Diseases Panel now indicate the disease's nickname if there's one
  - rscadd: Admin Diseases Panel is now accessible from the Admin tab instead of Debug.

  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed mobs like cockroach being invisible in cages because they appear
      bellow them. Mobs placed in cages have their plane changed to the default mob
      plane.
  - bugfix: Mice can no longer use the Hide verb when in a cage.
  - rscadd: Added some open growth dishes for mappers, both empty and containing a
      random disease
  - rscadd: The round end scoreboard now indicates which disease was spread the most,
      as well as its symptoms.
  - rscadd: Ghosts can now use the pathogen HUD
  - rscadd: Cats no longer chase mice while dead or uncounscious. Let them rest in
      peace.
  - rscadd: Mucus or Sputum caused by Coldingtons and Respiratory Putrefaction now
      only spawn if the mob is on top of a turf (so mice in vents won't spawn any).
      That should curb the amount of mucus spawning all around the station.
  - rscadd: Nanomed plus now has 8 vials to dispense. With the 6 in virology and the
      6 in Chemistry that's 20 vials in medbay.
  - bugfix: Fixed blank vaccines sometimes mysteriously already containing antigen
      brewed in other vaccines someplace else.
  - bugfix: Fixed Observer Pathogen HUD not properly updating when disease is getting
      removed from items and mobs.
  - bugfix: Fixed Plague Mice Invasion ruleset only spawning one mouse instead of
      up to five.

      of one, and missing a Disease Splicer board.
  GlassEclipse:
  - rscadd: Less than legitimate forces in your sector have learned how to build black
      market uplinks. They don't offer any goods for sale yet.
  Kharkov72:

  DamianX:
  - bugfix: Fixed speech disabilities not working if other genes were activated or
      the dude was a plasmaman.
  GlassEclipse:
  - rscadd: Added friendly cultist cyborg boards to the trader vendor. They can only
      be used on service borgs.
  Kharkov72:
  - rscadd: Under the hood roid tweaks, but the teleporter looks a bit different...
