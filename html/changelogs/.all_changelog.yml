      members, their objectives, and lots of other important information.

      visibility. The cult can use the new (very old in fact) Tear Reality rune during

      ends without the ritual being attempted, the crew will be safe from Nar-Sie
      for this round.
  - rscadd: If the cult attempts to raise Nar-Sie, they will have to defend a Blood
      Stone for a certain amount of time, and from that point onward all cultists
      will have a visible halo betraying their appearance to the crew. If the Blood
      Stone is destroyed, the ritual will end, and the cult will receive various handicaps,
      such has the halo remaining visible, and the cultist cap falling to zero.
  - rscadd: The Scoreboard now lists cultists in order of how much devotion they generated.
      The cult now "wins" or "loses" following various conditions, each with a different

      a victory by having some of its members escape alive and free aboard the shuttle.

      keeping some uncertainty around until actual occult shit is witnessed.

      increases (the same amount of cryotheum is consumed in the reaction no matter
      the temperature, only the cooling power is affected).
  nervere:
  - bugfix: Added a client verb, found in the OOC tab, called Check-My-BYOND-Version.

      endgame, with a slightly re-lifted appearance in line with the other cult constructs.

      they want for the few minutes until the round ends by just getting close to
      Nar-Sie. As back then they can disintegrate nearby doors, spot mobs through
      walls, teleport back to Nar-Sie with anything on their tile (now using blood

  - bugfix: Fixed some cult rituals failing to complete themselves.

      to absorb non-wizardly spells.
2024-06-26:
  Eneocho:
  - bugfix: Dexalin and Dexplus should be cyan as intended (instead of orange).
  - rscadd: Chocolate cows can be purchased from cargo for 45c, and can be milked
      for delicious chocolate milk.
  - rscadd: Chocolate milk, made the same way as Hot Coco is (5 parts milk 1 part
      coco) but without heating, and requires a starter sample of chocolate milk as
      a catalyst. Alternatively, can be milked from the aforementioned cows.

  boy2mantwicethefam:

      various projectile effects such as syringes from syringe guns. However, they
      have retained their weakness to slowdown caused by tasers.

      to if it is impacted by a projectile, as opposed to affecting every single character,

  - bugfix: (ApotheoticOrder provided the fix) Fixed the Lightning effects such as
      from the wizard's spell or the traitor's power gloves, the sprites will now
      properly show up. There is still a bug where the visuals do not line up in some
      circumstances with the target but it is a vast improvement over nothing.

  - bugfix: Wizards can no longer cast Lightning on themselves, which didn't do anything
      because they are immune to their own Lightning.
  - bugfix: Fixed an exploit where a gun could have unlimited damage by repeatedly
      attempting to perform point-blank shots with a ballistic weapon while not actually
      being able to fire the gun, such as through wearing boxing gloves, and then
      firing the weapon.

  - tweak: The EMP effect from the Lightning spell is now more severe.
  - tweak: The Lightning spell will no longer cause blurriness and stuttering.

      they should never miss.

      limb damage.

      of gibbing them, unless they are races with no blood such as plasmamen. They
      can chomp them again to gib them.

      plasmamen or liches.
  falcon2346:
  - imageadd: Added new sprites.

2024-07-19:

      menu when it didn't have any (such as the No Gun Allowed spell)
  - bugfix: A soulstone that is used to fuel a phylactery will now properly change
      to its inert icon. It will also no longer allow the user for a brief period
      of time to summon the shade it just used on the phylactery, which did nothing.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where certain elements for the No Gun Allowed, Bind Object
      and Magical Wardrobe spells were not being properly transferred due to a missing
      "user" variable.
  - bugfix: No Gun Allowed will now properly allow someone to fire a weapon again
      when removed.

      show spells learned from spellbooks as being absorbed.
  - bugfix: Should fix an error with the wizard and wizard's apprentice scoreboard
      where spells would show up at least twice, and generally improved them a little.
  - tweak: Adjusted the phylactery set's spawns so that the phylactery itself is more
      likely to appear above the necromancer clothes instead of under them.
  - bugfix: Removed unused code regarding monkeys being attacked with items, and the
      monkeys already take damage through other systems.
  - bugfix: Fixed a 7-year-old bug where slimes wouldn't do roughly 4 of the emotes
      they were meant to do once in a while because the emote system was checking
      to see if they were a monkey. They can now bounce, jiggle, light up for a bit
      and vibrate.
  - rscdel: Creatures and silicons that are attacked by burn-causing melee weapons
      such as the scrying orb will no longer be spammed with "Aargh it burns!" in
      every attack.
  - bugfix: Cleaned a section of the game's code where item attacks against slimes
      were defined. It should now be easier for future coders to read the piece of
      code where it used to be.
  - bugfix: Surrendering via a character that wasn't male nor female should no longer
      say "they surrender%s!", and will now properly say "they surrender!".

      less damaging weapons.
  - bugfix: Fixed a 7-year-old bug where non-sharp items with enough force did not
      have any chance of ripping off a limb as opposed to turning it into gibs. The
      check has now been fixed and now strong blunt melee weapons have a chance to
      rip off a broken limb instead of gibbing a broken limb.
  - bugfix: Removed unused code which concerned attacking with slimes in order to
      cause brain damage, which was unused for a variety of reasons including; regular
      slimes cannot be picked up, the code only works with items, and it only worked
      against non-carbon mobs which, as far as I know, are not affected by brain damage.
  - bugfix: Emotes that change their wording based on the user's gender will now properly
      affect non-humans such as monkeys.
  - bugfix: Removed an unused proc that was getting called by the code regarding monkeys
      being attacked with items.

2024-07-25:
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Wizards can upgrade the Pitbull spell to summon Toadline Pitbulls for
      20 spell points. Toadline Pitbulls move slightly slower than a regular pitbull,
      but have the advantage of being able to pass through airlocks and other mobs
      unimpeded (the airlock pass is NOT instantaneous, it takes a bit). They also
      do 1 more Brute damage on average compared to a regular Pitbull.
  - rscadd: Restores the Tracking Bacon dish that was commented out 12 years ago.
      They behave like regular tracking beacons, but can be eaten and can be cooked
      with 10u corn oil, 5u salt and a slab of meat.

  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Hologram Projectors nullspacing items worn or held by holograms

      or its projector in most cases.
  - rscadd: pAI slotted inside a Hologram Projector can now re-spawn their hologram

  boy2mantwicethefam:

  - rscadd: DNA syringes that contain a single block will now have the block's number
      in their name.
  - tweak: The Genetics' DNA Scanner's "transfer" function will now only irradiate
      as much as a DNA injector would, which is far less.

      press Insert to Spin and End to Perforate. In Hotkey mode, press F to Spin and
      R to Perforate.
  - bugfix: Using click-drag to perform the Perforate spell as a Soul Blade no longer
      sends you always south if you click-drag from the Soul Blade's tile. (courtesy
      of Yred)
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Juicy fruit will splash its reagents in an area.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a year-old bug where the Staff of Swip-Swap couldn't be wielded.
      Now it can be wielded to empower the projectile, which allows it to go through
      windows.
  - bugfix: (Admins) Changing the "detachable_cell" variable for energy weapons will
      now also handle whether it will give the gun the respective "Detach Cell" verb
      or not.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where a person that has carp pheromones in their system would
      not stink up the place properly if someone nearby was dead, which would unpredictably
      cause the message to not reliably show up to other players in the area.

  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Squash plants! Mutate a pumpkin to get your very own squash. They are
      not as efficient at making nutriment, but are filled with precious Squash (reagent).
  - rscadd: The Squash reagent/drug is a double edged performance enhancer that boosts
      your tackling abilities. If consumed by non dwarves, they'll suffer brute damage
      for 30s before turning into a dwarf (as long as Squash is still in their system).
      If they run out of squash, the recoil from growing back to normal size will
      break every bone in their body, unless their bones were reinforced with Degencalcium
      beforehand.
  - rscadd: The Squash drug can be manufactured by mixing equal parts Manly Dorf,
      Degenerate Calcium and Hyperzine.
  - tweak: The Caber can now self recharge once per minute and has the proper sharpness
      flags when on its detonated state.
  - rscadd: "Methamphetamine can be made stationside by enterprising chemists. Slower\
      \ and way more expensive to make but overall better than hyperzine, and performance\
      \ enhancing, too. It does make you tweak out at times, though. Made by mixing\
      \ 1 part Albuterol, 3 parts Hydrogen, 1 part Chlorine and 5u Carbon (catalyst),\
      \ then heating to 200\xB0C, which makes 2 parts meth."
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: A neo-ultra-capitalism mode Old Vendotron will no longer kill itself by
      summoning a lot of hostile creatures that it would proceed to go to combat with,
      and now the creatures it creates become part of the same faction as it.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Old Vendotron's plate attack so that it will no longer throw
      plates on its own tile. It will now properly throw them away.
  - tweak: Slimes will now become ravenous in the presence of monkeys, causing them
      to become hungry and thus try to eat anything they can reach (including the
      monkeys), which also allows the slimes to feed far sooner on the monkeys than
      they otherwise would.
  - tweak: Slimes can now store slightly more nutrition, meaning that they can develop
      into adult slimes and then split by eating two monkeys in a smaller form instead
      of having to eat a monkey in a smaller form and another monkey in a larger form.
  hacker-on-steroids:
  - rscadd: ripley killdozer kit - adds tons of armor and allows you to put guns onto
      the ripley
  - rscadd: add killdozer kit to uplink (10tc)
  - rscadd: add killdozer kit to r&d (illegal 2)
2024-08-09:
  Pancakemines:
  - tweak: Surgery freezers now blink when containing brains with a player ghost inside
      them.
  - imageadd: Added new pulsing heart surgery box sprite.
  SonixApache:
  - rscadd: Detective scanners can now be alt-clicked to switch to scan-only mode,
      which prevents it from being put into boxes/coats/etc. Do note that this also
      prevents the scanner from taking fingerprint cards.
  - experiment: You can now use hand labelers on storage items like boxes and backpacks,
      among other things. If you notice something breaking with labelling, report
      it.
2024-08-10:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Airflow is now visible, as dust motes can be seen flying around between
      zones when the pressure differential is high enough for there to be wind.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Vomit can be electrolized into equal parts sacid and nutriment, or made
      with equal parts sacid and nutriment, plus 5u Enzyme.
  jwhitak:
  - rscadd: Adds wooden buckets! Two wood planks to craft.
  - bugfix: Friendly carp ranching will no longer result in hostile carp.
  - tweak: Circular saws and variants can chop down trees.
  - bugfix: Fixes certain sounds from being heard from further away than intended.
  - tweak: Tools/surgery tools without sounds will attempt to play other possibly
      related sounds before giving up.
  - tweak: Wooden walls and girders now take time to chop down (5 seconds). Fireaxes
      are faster (1 second).
  - rscadd: You can now wet hides in a sink/groundwater, and air dry them slowly.
      Hot rooms still dry them faster.
  - rscadd: Wet leather now tells you if it's drying, and how much it has left to
      dry.
  - bugfix: Fixed wet leather deleting itself in your hands.
2024-08-12:
  CrazyAmphibian:
  - bugfix: The lich hardsuit will now use the correct helmet
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed dust motes remaining forever on turfs that change type
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - tweak: Lights have been added to HoS office on packed station.
  - tweak: A missing cable has been added to packed station gateway room.
  - tweak: The paper and nanopaper on packed station mechanics have been made easier
      to access, swapping the places of the bin and a locker in the room.
2024-08-13:
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: 'Changes the sharp, brunt, and quality modifiers for a couple materials:'
  - tweak: Gold brunt modifier goes from 0.5x to 0.9x, and quality modifier from 1.7x
      to 1.8x
  - tweak: Silver brunt modifier goes from 0.7x to 0.2x, and sharpness modifier from
      0.7x to 1.8x
  - tweak: Mythril quality modifier goes from 1.5x to 3x, to account for it being
      so scarce and generally being outperformed by Phazon and Bananium.
2024-08-16:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Hydro Tray lights now update immediately after pouring a reagent into it
      (reagents still get processed by the tray over time, but the lights anticipate
      how much the reagents currently held will change the tray's variables)
  - tweak: Paint reagents are now slightly toxic to hydroponics plants, except flax
      oil which is slightly nutritious.
  - tweak: Water and Holy Water now hydrate trays just as much
  - tweak: Toxins in hydro tray and soil now become progressively more visible as
      it builds up, instead of suddenly becoming visible past a threshold.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: All botany mutagens now take the same average time to tick and to get consumed
      (as fast as the previous fast chems).
  - tweak: Phazon weapons and hammers (blacksmithing) will no longer delete themselves
      when used a bunch, and will instead teleport to a random tile within a radius
      around itself, scaling with quality, up to a radius of 13 tiles with legendary
      weapons.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - tweak: Lotto tickets with numbers from the random event are now more likely to
      be winners, as the highest ballcount is now 18 and not 32.
  falcon2346:
  - rscadd: Added the is_dexterous variable to mob.dmi that mimics most of the effects
      of methylin.
  toomykins:
  - tweak: nanopaste is now small instead of normal
  - tweak: implants are now  tiny instead of normal sized
  west3436:
  - bugfix: You can no longer grab "fire" out of a burning bookcase.
  - tweak: Wooden tables and chairs will now burn twice as fast.
  - rscadd: Added a Fire Suppression preset to Air Alarms which replaces Oxygen and
      Plasma with Nitrogen in its area.
  - bugfix: Fixed Flatpack Fabricators not using parts shared via Bluespace Matter
      Bins.
  - rscadd: Added Silencing Spray which can be used to silence any mob/obj/machine
      which it's sprayed on.
2024-08-18:
  DeityLink:
  - imageadd: The old vaguely dandelion-looking weeds have had an art pass and now
      look slightly more like dandelions.
  - rscadd: Added dandelion seeds to the MegaSeed Servitor's contraband products.
  - rscadd: Dandelions may be harvested as soon as their yellow flowers have bloomed,
      but waiting further will allow the flowers to turn into pappus, which can be
      harvested themselves.
  - rscadd: Dandelion flowers can be ground for their yellow dye, or turned into leafy
      incense by using it on an incense oil container.
  - rscadd: Dandelion pappus can be used 3 times to spread their seeds onto nearby
      empty trays or soil.
  - rscadd: Dandelions both in trays or harvested as pappus will spread their seeds
      when exposed to air currents.
  - imageadd: Added in-hand icons for Dandelions, Sunflowers, Harebells, Novaflowers
      and Moonflowers.
  - bugfix: Pre-mapped tower-cap logs can now be properly have their seeds extracted.
  - bugfix: Flavor texts when plants mutate and whatnot should now properly account
      for the plant's designation being singular or plural.
  - rscadd: Dandelions can be mutate into Dandelions(?) which re-use the old weeds
      sprites.
2024-08-19:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed gases leaving hydro trays despite their lid being closed.
  - bugfix: Fixed vines spawning outside hydro trays despite their lid being closed
      when they have just acquired the mutation.
  - bugfix: Dead plants can no longer mutate further.
  - bugfix: Fixed connected pipes not updating their atmosphere as they should when
      canisters and hydroponic trays connected to them change their content.
  - tweak: You can now pour water and nutriments inside hydroponic trays even with
      their lid closed. The flavor text is slightly different to reflect you using
      its injection port. Likewise using a hoe or clippers on a tray now has flavor
      text specify that you use its access port.
2024-08-20:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed seconds display when checking your wristwatch.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: Holomen no longer suffocate on low air conditions nor get intoxicated by
      atmospheric gases.
  - rscadd: You can now buy semi-randomized small town brewery beer kegs in cargo
      for 60 credits, these are safe.
  - rscadd: Hacking the cargo console lets you buy the off-brand beer kegs for 40
      credits, which can contain dangerous chemicals, but also extra special chems.
  - rscadd: These beer kegs will be VERY contaminated (at least 1 dangerous chemical
      on average) if the station is on the DOES NOT TIP backdoor.
  - bugfix: Adds Iced Beer to the COLDDRINKS define (i had forgotten iced beer was
      a thing).
  - tweak: The Does Not Tip backdoor uplink description also mentions it poisoning
      beers.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - spellcheck: The mounted sleepers and jail cells on mechs no longer print the object
      types to the occupant when they run out of power.
  - bugfix: Ghost names no longer show up in the list of things ejected from a cryo
      cell.
2024-08-21:
  CrazyAmphibian:
  - rscadd: The RPD will now display icons next to the names of pipes (you may have
      to re-open the menu to see them)
  Dacendeth:
  - tweak: Grues health regen has been lowered massively
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Hydroponic trays containing dead weeds may now be overtaken by fresh new
      weeds.
  - rscadd: Plants exposed to radiation now have a chance to mutate. Young plants
      planted in the past minute have a high chance of mutating, while older ones
      have a very small chance of a minor gene mutation (if all your trays in Hydroponics
      have plants and a radiation storm occurs, expect 3-5 of them to display a small
      mutation). Furthermore, closing the tray's lid completely removes any chance
      of radiation-induced mutations.
  - tweak: If a plant mutates to different species, it will no longer have an additional
      small mutation applied at the same time.
  Eneocho:
  - spellcheck: Typofix on the NO TIP beer keg description.
  - bugfix: Plant analyzers will now tell you the chems a plant is making when scanning
      a tray, as was intended.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - tweak: AIs can now track mobs as they move, rather than jumping to them every
      second.
  - tweak: AI messages when they stop being able to follow a target are now more general,
      as cameras are not the only thing that stops tracking.
  west3436:
  - bugfix: Igniters will now start fires 100% of the time
2024-08-22:
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Expands the braindamage speech, adding a good amount of extra words and
      syllables that will be replaced with their dumb counterpart. Braindamaged players
      might also find themselves forgetting a word once in a while.
  - rscadd: Braindamaged players might find themselves gibbering incoherently if they
      try to speak too fast.
  - tweak: Reduces the forced screaming chance and forced stutter chance when talking
      while braindamaged by 15 and 5 percent respectively, since those values felt
      better with this change.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - tweak: Catbeasts defiling rooms for threat generation should now happen as soon
      as they enter the room.
2024-08-24:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added Moody Lights to Hydroponic trays. This concerns not only their warning
      lights, but also the tray's own light toggle which lights up the plant quite
      nicely in the dark, and the plant's own bioluminescence. Plant may have custom
      moody light overlays, but ones that don't just glow all over if the bioluminescent
      gene is spliced into them.
  - rscadd: Alt-Click on Hydroponic trays now brings up a radial menu to quickly toggle
      its light, its lid, or set its label.
  - rscadd: Ctrl-Click (while anchored) lets you quickly toggle the lid, which was
      what Alt-Click previously did.
  - rscadd: Hydroponic trays now react to EMPs, having a chance to turn off their
      light and toggle their lid.
  - imageadd: Re-sprited the hydroponic tray lids. Added animations and sounds when
      you toggle them.
  - imageadd: Hydroponic tray sprites have been tweaked to display whether their internal
      light is on or off.
  - imageadd: The water level in hydroponic trays now visibly goes down.
  - imageadd: Some large plants now have an alternative appearance when constrained
      by a closed lid.
  - imageadd: If a plant exudes plasma or sleeping gas and its lid is closed, you
      can now see the gas through the lid.
  - imageadd: Improved the way plants grow visually so that more of their sprited
      stages may appear over the course of their growth.
  - imageadd: Hydroponic Trays now have a different sprite when they are un-anchored.
  - imageadd: Hydroponic Trays now have a visible vent when wrenched on top of a connector.
  - bugfix: Fixed some more the way Hydroponic Trays transfer gas when connected to
      a pipenet, or when their lid is open in general. You may now even use them as
      slow, one-way, passive vents.
  - tweak: Newly built hydroponic trays now require you to fill them with water.
  - rscadd: You can now build plastic hydroponic trays! Easy to build, but just like
      with soil it won't provide you with any of the sensor data.
  - tweak: Hydroponic Trays now consume a bit of power.  Just a bit though.
2024-08-25:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: The following changes have been done to the Rampant Brand Intelligence
      event. The original infected vending machine is now guaranteed to emit one of
      its custom slogans when it infects another vending machine, making players more
      likely to find it (and to hear those slogans at all like jesus christ the odds
      were ridiculously low). When the event ends, ALL infected machines stop throwing
      items instead of only 90 percent, and their speakers now return to their previous
      value instead of always being deactivated.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Lucky coins on a string have a second chance to be pulled out successfully,
      scaling with coin luck (not yours).
  - rscadd: Metastable Mutagen, a chem that selectively mutates the chemicals on plants,
      letting you semi-reliably remove (and add) chems via mutations. Made with equal
      parts Unstable Mutagen and Charcoal, with 5u Enzyme as a catalyst.
  - rscadd: Metatable Mutagen, a sibling to Metastable Mutagen that does the same,
      but it will also randomly transform into any of the other tables in the game
      if sprayed onto them. Made with equal parts Untable Mutagen (the botany version)
      and Charcoal, with 5u Enzyme as a catalyst.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - tweak: Lighting and object subsystems are now notably faster, with about 2.2 seconds
      shaved off server initialization overall on boxstation as an example
2024-08-26:
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - bugfix: The chameleon DNA gene now properly sets mob alpha back to normal when
      deactivated.
  - bugfix: Ghosts can now properly admin possess objects.
  - bugfix: Deleting an item now properly releases possession, if any.
  - tweak: Posessing and releasing is now handled in one verb.
  - tweak: The possession verb now releases the mob from the previous object it was
      possessing.
  SonixApache:
  - bugfix: you can now pretend to be a silicon with voice changers as was intended
2024-08-27:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Apiaries no longer require you to build them into an hydroponics tray!
      Just click an adjacent floor while holding the kit.
  - imageadd: Apiaries have new sprites to commemorate their graduation from being
      tray-bound.
  - imageadd: Apiary kits now have in-hand icons.
  - tweak: You no longer need a hatchet to harvest an apiary and can now do so bare-handed.
      Doing it this way no longer deconstructs the apiary so you can just calm the
      bees and let them return to it on their own. Hatchets (or alternatively crowbars)
      are still required to deconstruct them, which still also harvests them at the
      same time if they contain honey.
  - soundadd: Added sounds for building/deconstructing apiaries, and for pouring BeezEz
      in them.
  - rscadd: Apiaries and hives can burn down at long last.
  jwhitak:
  - rscadd: Blacksmiths can now estimate the quality of their result before quenching
      their work by examining it.
  - rscadd: Smithing now has several new visual effects, including lighting, hot sparks,
      and visibly different unforged items.
  - bugfix: Fixed several blacksmithing bugs, including lighting cold forges that
      can't heat anything.
2024-08-29:
  CrazyAmphibian:
  - tweak: Changed the RPD menu so that the options are always visible
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Moody Lights have been added to all airlocks, firelocks, and blast doors.
  - bugfix: Fixed christmas lights now actually emitting any light. Their lit up sprite
      also now appears over darkness.
  - bugfix: Fixed snow tiles not regenerating snow like they should sometimes.
  - bugfix: Fixed each snow tile and christmas light having a duplicate on top of
      them.
  - tweak: Reworked the way snow tiles hold snow so instead of losing snow from the
      duplicate tile you get even more! Each tile now has 10 snow which it regenerates
      by one every 30 seconds. You can grab 1 snow by hand, or 3 at a time by shovel.
      If the tile reaches 0 snow it disappears.
  - imageadd: Re-added the grabbed and digged snow tile sprites so you can easily
      see whether a tile is full of snow, or whether it's one shovel hit away from
      disappearing.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Cows will mutate their milk type when exposed to Phazon, unless they themselves
      can make Phazon, in which case they will not mutate their milk further.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - bugfix: Coinboxes can now come out of vending machines again.
  - tweak: Coinboxes and vendpacks now eject from crowbar destroying vending machines.
      Vendpacks still require inserted cardboard for this.
  - tweak: Coinboxes can now be recycled for metal, under the electronics category.
  - tweak: To compensate coinboxes being recyclable, and as to not be an infinite
      metal source, they are now required in their frame build step. A no access requirement
      version of them can be built as a metal stack recipe to aid this.
  - bugfix: Mech syringe guns now actually fire their syringes properly, making them
      finally useful for something other than getting fast research done.
2024-08-30:
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - tweak: Placing stacks into storage items now automatically adds it to stacks of
      the same type, if possible.
  - tweak: Ore satchels and derivatives now show the number of ores in all stacks
      per type.
  - bugfix: Sheet snatchers no longer cause bad screen issues.
  west3436:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where players would appear to be on fire without actually
      burning.
  - tweak: Mobs will now catch on fire as soon as they step into a fire.
2024-08-31:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: The Floral Somatoray has been refactored and should now behave more as
      you might expect. You can use it on trays both at range and adjacently, although
      if someone is standing in-between they might get hit instead.
  - rscadd: You can once again change the brute damage of bees by using the Floral
      Somatoray on apiaries while it's set to Morphology, while Development controls
      the yield. There are plans to allow further genetic alterations of bees in the
      future.
  - rscadd: You can now use a solder to "un-emag" a floral somatoray.
  - imageadd: The Floral Somatoray has had a sprite pass with its appearance depending
      on its currently selected mode. The rays it fire also change color based on
      the selected mode.
  - soundadd: The Floral Somatoray makes a new sound when charging and firing at stuff.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - spellcheck: Typos on the mysterious d20 and mechanical toyboxes have been fixed
  - bugfix: The hobo shacks and mine surprises now have dynamic lighting again.
  - bugfix: Ghosts and admins can now jump to the areas of mining surprises and hobo
      shacks.
  - bugfix: Normal ghosts can now haunt into the chapel again.
  - rscadd: Admins now get a message if a bag of holding was quick equipped into another
      bag of holding really fast with hotkeys.
  SonixApache:
  - tweak: slimefolk now get a proper feedback message if they don't have any limbs
      to regenerate with their special ability
  hacker-on-steroids:
  - bugfix: vent pumps no longer appear on when unpowered
2024-09-02:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Chaplains who adhere to the Belmont religion now spawn with a box containing
      clothing reminiscent of Richter Belmont, and a flask of Sacred Water in their
      pocket. They can also throw their bible to hit people around them with it.
  - rscadd: Sacred Water is a new reagent that turns Holy Water into more of itself
      when in contact with it. When splashed on a floor, it creates sacred flames
      that only burn the unholy (that is, vampires, cultists, and any other supernatural
      creature)
  - rscadd: Players may now forge a Battle Cross out of silver at an anvil. Battle
      Crosses are basically boomerangs that deal bonus damage to supernatural creatures,
      but they only return to the hands of those of the Belmont religion.
  - experiment: Boomerangs have been rewritten from scratch and now behave more like
      you would expect from a boomerang in a video game. They are now a lot more reliable
      so their damage has been lowered from 16 to 10, but they still feel really strong
      so I'm looking forward to feedback by players who have been on both ends of
      a boomerang throw.
  - imageadd: Boomerangs have also gotten a re-sprite.
  - imageadd: Attacking supernatural creatures with holy weapons now displays a visual
      effect.
  - imageadd: Kamina and Simon's glasses have gotten some visual adjustments on top
      of proper object icons. Furthermore, you can now unleash their power by using
      them in your hand and throwing them.
  - bugfix: Fixed the wrong icon appearing for some bibles in the religion picker
      interface.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - bugfix: The mode change buttons on assemblies now properly refresh them.
  - tweak: Assembly windows now refresh as the timers tick down, instead of manually
      with the refresh button.
  - tweak: Unnecessary close and refresh buttons have now been removed from the UIs
      of timers, proximity sensors, infrared sensors and light tile remotes as these
      functions happen normally now.
2024-09-03:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to walk through closed Firelocks after clicking on them
      while not having permission due to dangerous atmos conditions.
  - bugfix: Fixed the leather glove & handwraps not showing up on the character's
      sprite when worn.
  - bugfix: Door Moody Lights no longer look much brighter than they should when door
      lights are flashing during their opening/closing/deny/emag animations.
  - bugfix: Fixed stuff landing in disposals through windows.
  SECBATON-GRIFFON:
  - spellcheck: The merch computer entry for small cages now has a capitalised title,
      better grammar, and no extra full stop.
  - spellcheck: Every other erroneous double full stop has also been fixed.
  - bugfix: Players can now actually disallow item use when targeting with guns. As
      described, this will not count for turf or HUD clicks.
  - bugfix: Moving in a vehicle now counts as moving when targeted with a gun.
  - tweak: The message the player receives on being targeted now more helpfully tells
      them which restrictions are or are not in place.
  - bugfix: Putting stacks in storage now properly updates their materials.
  west3436:
  - bugfix: Cigarettes will no longer ignite smokers. Big Tobacco wins again.
2024-09-04:
  jwhitak:
  - bugfix: Thermostats now properly work when setting new temperatures.
  west3436:
  - tweak: Updated rust-g to version 3.4.0.
2024-09-06:
  west3436:
  - bugfix: MoMMIs, Engineering cyborgs, and any cyborgs which have a fire shield
      installed will no longer catch on fire or take damage from fire.
  - bugfix: Objects will properly stop smoking once they are removed from a hot room.
2024-09-07:
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Clowns can buy Insulted gloves from the autodrobe, these may also be found
      where budget insulos would be laying around on april fools. Don't cut wires
      while wearing them, or you will get insulted when you get shocked.
2024-09-08:
  DeityLink:
