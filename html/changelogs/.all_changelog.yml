      (between 3 and 6 minutes) but the cloning time and biomass use can be reduced

      turns user into a hulk.  Unlike a hulk, however, Horrors can punch people so
      hard they have a 25% chance of flying down a hallway.  Can also force open doors
      (50% chance after 5 sec).  Throwing speed bonus.  Takes twice as much fire damage
      as a normal human.  <u>YOU CANNOT RETURN TO HUMAN FORM AFTER CHANGING INTO A
      HORROR.</u>

      the doors, the kitchen's floor, etc...)

      in certain directions.
  - tweak: Mobs will now always appear to face south on pictures. A necessary evil

      before he gets summoned get a message)

      way.<br>Plants now have ideal heat, light and pressure values, as well as tolerances

      the new code.<br>Space vines now make use of seed data if spawned with a reference
      and can be harvested from.<br>Vines now cause physical damage if they are carnivorous,
      and inject reagents if their seed data includes them.<br>Vines will die if they

      instead of having to juggle modes.
  - tweak: Rudimentary upgrade system for the recharge station. Pop it open and slap

      now have meson vision as a toggle, no longer is an equip. As a result does not
      use cell charge as well. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They
      will now generate consumables passively, albeit at a slower rate than if they
      were in a recharger. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanotrasen
      has finally figured out how to install magnets in Engineering borgs, no longer
      will they slip and slide for days in space. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      added.
  - rscadd: Ringer app. You can toggle it on/off and change it's frequency. You'll

  - tweak: the PNG nanomaps of the mining asteroid and the derelict have been edited
      so they don't feature mineral deposits, galleries, or rooms anymore. (so people

      minerals and whatnot)

      and all solars are connected to them. If you stray off the path, you are fair
      game for any bullshit I could have thought of and added to the abandoned parts
      to make your life miserable, so grow a pair of balls if you decide to explore.
      Unlike box, maintenance doesn't form a clear circle around the station. The
      abandoned parts will often offer good shortcuts if you know how to navigate
      them.
