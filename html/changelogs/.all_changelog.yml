  - tweak: 'Current priority round-start is: Emitters > APCs and machinery > Recharging
      an APC > recharging an SMES. So, the SMES won''t recharge until there''s enough

      power to run'
  - tweak: Emitters can run at low power so long as you can meet at least 30% of their

      the station requires in that moment, rather than how much it is consuming'

      you have engineering access. Feel free to redirect power from security to cargo
