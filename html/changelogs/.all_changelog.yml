  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: Added a trash compactor, primarily for use on PackedStation, but you can
      order your own from cargo.
  - rscadd: Compactor makes trash cubes. You can get the contents out by using the
      recycler, or just blowing them open.
  - rscadd: Monkeycubes can now hold any type of non-simple mob, including humans.
      Surely this has nothing to do with the new trash compactor...
  - rscadd: Added an industrial vaporizer, available at the EngiVend. Requires engineering
      access to use, when filled with vapor salts it can draw on a room's power to
      synthesize water or nitrogen and therefore refill the atmosphere.  It can also
      be filled with oxygen, nitrogen, and/or water to lower power demand.

      of the floor

      area creation into two options - create room, and create new drawing. Create
      room functions same as the old blueprints, create new drawing lets you define
      the new area by hand.
  - rscadd: Chief engineer's station blueprints can now delete areas created by blueprints
      and building permits.
  - rscadd: Added admin-only blueprints that can edit and delete station areas.
2017-07-29:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed a server-freezing bug caused when a blob tries to expand on the
      AME. The AME now properly becomes a blob.
  - imageadd: Fixed the AME's sprites so AME shield parts don't appear invisible or
      badly oriented anymore.
  - bugfix: Admin Ghosts can now access APCs like silicons, like they are supposed
      to.
  - rscadd: Marauders, Seraph and Maulers can now perform rocket dashes. Let's them
      throw themselves forward without the need for a Mass Driver, though it has a
      short range indoors.
  - experiment: BEEKEEPING 3.0!!! Rewrote bee code basically from scratch.
  - rscadd: Bees now reach for plants to pollinate them. After a few pollens have
      been gathered or some time has passed, the bee will return to the apiary and
      the pollen it brought is then processed into honey.
  - rscadd: As previously, benefits are applied to plants when bees hover over them,
      except now they'll be aiming for them specifically.
  - rscadd: Chemicals usually found in the fruits of the pollinated plants will find
      their way into the honey, which means you can produce apple-flavoured honey,
      cacao-flavoured honey, plasticide-flavoured honey, etc...
  - rscadd: Bees periodically consume some of the reagents in their apiary to keep
      their nutrition level up. Should they end up consuming toxic reagents (because
      you let your bees pollinate amanitas, plasticide, or other dangerous plants)
      the colony's toxic level will rise. At 30 percent toxicity, bees that come out
      to pollinate might instead come to kill.  At 50 percent toxicity, bees will
      start taking damage from their own toxicity. As toxicity rises, the odds of
      either effect increase. Oh, and the toxic portion of the damage they deal also
      increases. Bees deal up to double toxic damage at 100 percent toxicity.
  - rscadd: Bees will group up/disband depending on the situation/their whims. 20
      bees is the maximum that can gather in a single swarm.
  - rscadd: Individual bees are now tracked when outside the hive. If you net some
      bees and release them elsewhere, they'll keep their pollens and damage values.
  - rscadd: Queen bees will now come outside the hive to pollinate as well. Instead
      of creating honey when they come back, they'll create royal jelly, which allows
      workers to turn into queens if there are no queens inside the hive at a time.
      Royal Jelly has the same medicinal properties as honey, only a little more efficient.
      Both reagents stack very well.
  - rscadd: Should there be multiple queens inside the hive, and an empty apiary nearby,
      a queen will swarm out with a dozen of workers to go claim that apiary.
  - rscadd: When you deal damage to a swarm of bees, the damage will be taken by the
      individual bees that make it up, killing them one by one. Thus you can see the
      swarm thin out as you kill more and more bees, and its damage going down as
      well. Also, non-precisely aimed gunshots are more likely to hit large swarms.
  - rscadd: Bees now leave corpses when they die. These can be cleaned up.
  - rscadd: The color of the honey dripping from apiaries, and the honeycombs extracted
      from them now depends on the reagents inside the apiary.
  - rscadd: Beezeez packets now have their own sprites, and can be eaten like chips
      if you wish.
  - rscadd: Added bees to the vermin infestation event. They spawn from wild beehives,
      which can be broken for some honeycombs.
  - rscadd: Admins can now force vermin infestation events (for debug purposes, mostly)
  - rscadd: You can now hit a mob with the Briefcase Full of Bees to make the bees
      attack them. Opening the briefcase makes them attack YOU.
  - rscadd: Impermeable clothing raises your chances to avoid bee stings, thus spacesuits
      offer almost complete protection from bees.
  - rscadd: When calmed by getting sprayed with water, bees will remain in place for
      a while, then they'll head back to their hive by themselves if they have one.
  - bugfix: Emptying a net full of bees outside a beehive no longer empties it INSIDE
      YOUR OWN BODY
  - tweak: As bees need to come back alive to produce honey, Vox can no longer raise
      bees on their outposts. That is until we introduce N2 breathing mutant bees.
  Furbeh:
  - rscadd: Wizard mode spawns a number of wizards proportional to the number of players.
  - tweak: Ratio currently is 10 players to 1 wizard,  minimum of 1 wizard.
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: The pAI can now inject chems (or hand food to master) from anywhere, even
      a bag, internals box, or slotted into the PDA.
  - tweak: When ejecting a pAI from the PDA, it will attempt to place into your hand
      instead of the floor.
  ultraplen:
  - rscadd: Makes the confectionator obtainable
  unid15:
  - tweak: Arm, leg and head organ items are now considered small. Hands and feet
      are tiny and fit in pockets
  - bugfix: Amputated limbs now keep their damage, and no longer heal when attached.
  - tweak: Hands and feet no longer go flying when the organ they're attached to is
      amputated, now they stay connected to it. Use any sharp item on a separated
      arm or a leg to cut its hand or foot off
2017-07-30:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed infinite loops caused by Mechas trying to knock down mobs that you
      can't knock down.
  - rscadd: Added new rigs for the Syndicate Elite Strike Team, to replace the old-looking
      black space suits. Their armor values are midway between nuke ops' and deathsquads'.
  - imageadd: OSIPR ammo bar is now red, to fit the Elite Syndies better.
  - rscadd: Space Nazis! They draw their weapons in presence of an enemy. They can
      run out of ammo and switch from ranged to melee combat. Mecha Hitler is here
      too.
  - rscadd: Luger P08, can be looted off small-fry nazi corpses.

  JMWTurner:
  - rscadd: Centcom received some huge changes. The holding pen has been removed,
      thus ridding ourselves of the last proof that Space Ninjas ever were a thing.
      ERT and Deathsquad bases have gone through massive overhauls.
  - rscadd: Added an admin-spawned suit dispenser machine, that lets admins quickly
      spawn sets of items. For now there are some in the custom strike team bases,
      later they might see some use in the thunderdome.
  - rscadd: Admins can now spawn custom strike teams, they have a small empty base,
      fit with the tools for admins to quickly set up a custom squad, as well as their
      shuttle's destination locations. honksquads have never been this easy to set
      up.
  - rscadd: The Deathsquad and Elite Syndie shuttles work at last! They have two destination
      on each stations, one that's in space near the station, and the other that consists
      of ramming their ship inside the station!
  - rscadd: Players that wish to use shuttles to head over to the centcom Z-level
      now need to receive explicit permission from the admins. Admins receive a notifications
      when a flight is attempted, and can accept or deny it with a click. Both sides
      have the option of giving a reason.
  - bugfix: Fixed the action buttons (headlights, holominimap, etc...) of strike team
      members being invisible when they spawn.
  N3X15:
  - tweak: Blob gamemode now only permits a single blob at roundstart.

  - tweak: Improved water puzzle's rewards
  - bugfix: Fixed stone walls creating vacuum when mined
  - rscadd: Organ transplants now carry over mutations like claws, talons and beaks,
      as well as other combat capabilities. When punching, your active hand determines
      the damage done. There are legends of a species so powerful they can send people
      flying with their punches - the ability to do that is stored in their arms,
      rather than hands.
  - rscadd: Damage dealt to organs from different species will now receive correct
      multipliers - for example, a skellington head will always take more brute damage,
      while a ghoul one will take less. In addition, limbs from some species won't
      bleed.
