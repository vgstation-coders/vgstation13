      ways) anything that wasn't a mob. This may have slight balance implications

2019-02-11:
  I-VAPE-VOX-CLOACA-EVERY-DAY-OF-MY-LIFE:

      retain their remaining combustible when extinguished.

      of extra duration. The thurible also comes with a built in lighter.
  - tweak: the vampire smiting abilities of the null rod have been moved over to the
      thurible (since it's made of silver). Null rods can still disrupt their powers.
      Thuribles also deal brutal damage to undead simple animals, such as zombies.
  - bugfix: The character preference preview now properly displays chaplains with
      laceups shoes.
  - rscadd: The cult holomap is now accessible from altars, and displays the position
      of other cult buildings and runes. Path runes are color-coded by word. Of course

      the HoP's office!

      station holomap. It still gives your coordinates when used, but you may no longer
      place markers on it, but frankly until there is a significant demand for it
      I'll bury that feature. On the bright side this means it now works on all maps
      and automatically updates with all map changes.

      it refunds 10 (down from 40).
  - tweak: Blobstorms are now much cheaper, require less extreme conditions to fire,
      and get a fake meteor warning at first (as well as more delay before announcing
      it was a blobstorm after all); roundstart blobs remain the same

      added

      nothing, but now it will make you regenerate twice as fast but make you go hungry

      that they can soulstone the people they sacrifice by using an empty soul blade.

      It has to be the real deal vodka ala tunguska triple distilled, not derivatives
      or knock-offs!

      to blow up instead of reducing the explosion!

      may now force a re-roll at an altar by communing with Nar-Sie if the target
      either had their body destroyed, or fled the station's Z level. This means that

  Exxion:
  - bugfix: Fixed two ancient bugs that caused fires to burn hotter and release more
      CO2 than intended. Fires in general are now much colder and produce much, much
      less pressure. This affects bombs as well. Since six years of balance happened
      since these bugs were introduced, some numbers are probably going to have to
      be tweaked.
  SirSkeleto:

      and instead stab the target.

  - rscadd: Adds an optional locking module for spacepods.

      and ask questions later. Sprites courtesy of @otatoh."'
2019-03-09:
  Exxion:
  - tweak: Almost doubled energy released per mole of reactant in fires, again. This
      should bring bombs and burn chambers back to roughly where they were before,
      or only slightly lower. This also affects all other fires, but any time the
      ratio of reactants to total gas is low, they'll still be far weaker than before.
      (If you see this message but don't observe the effects in-game, blame whoever
      merged the PR)
  Irradiation:
  - tweak: Malfunctioning AIs can now occur dynamically midround with incredibly low
      odds. Dead/Low Lowpop can't roll midround MALF.
  MadmanMartian:
  - tweak: Destroying all the blob cores no longer ends the round entirely. Instead,
      it removes the lockdown upon death.
  - bugfix: Blob infestation, upon reaching a certain point, now blocks the shuttle
      from being called.

      from a medihud, and not a records console.
2019-03-10:

      per 100 gunk tiles from the previous round

      traitors, less nuke ops and malf.
  - tweak: High danger (potentially round ending) roles have had their ruleset costs
      increased, which lowers the chance of them happening at the same time.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused two roundstart rulesets to proc at population
      levels that should never allow it.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixes the Sith bundle Sith Lightning appearing in the wizard's spellbook
      instead of the normal Lightning. Sith Lightning is weaker than normal Lightning
      (deals half damage).

      in the meantime.

  - tweak: The character preference window will now tell you what color your skin
      tone is instead of just a numerical value

      civilization. Xenoarchs are recommended to look for parts that are compatible
      with current machinery.

  - tweak: Using a communicate rune mid-cast will allow you to write a "Cult reminder",
      which will be engraved in the memory of all present cultists and all new converts.
  - tweak: Bloodcult now requires security members to start.
2019-03-15:
  PJB3005:

  MadmanMartian:
  - bugfix: In the event of the crew successfully defeating a blob infestation, the
      lockdown will ACTUALLY be lifted.
  - bugfix: Fixes some worn items not appearing on some species. Now it will use the
      normal human sprites, so there will be irregularities, but it beats the icon
      not showing at all.
  - tweak: The method of repairing a broken vending machine has been made more obvious.
  eplgr:
  - tweak: Body bags now take time to open and close when there's someone inside standing
      up

2019-03-17:
  GeneralVeers25:

  - bugfix: Midround From Ghost rules will no longer fail because of picking someone
      who is dead but not ghosted.
  - rscadd: The game will no longer end by killing an antagonist, but if that antagonist

  - rscadd: For roundstart blob only, Clowns may select Clownscape, Chaplains may
      select Skellington, and Engineering staff may select AME.
  - rscadd: Ninja gloves now drain anything with a cell (incl tasers, eguns, cyborgs,
      mechas). If they are on cooldown or the target has less than 100 charge, you
      will interact with the target normally. Feel free to headpat that unpowered
      borg.
  - rscadd: Wearing ninja gloves renders you untrackable by an AI.
  - tweak: The ninja katana no longer conducts electricity.

2019-03-21:
  SonixApache:
  - tweak: E20s are now once again locked to the librarian's uplink.
2019-03-22:
  Kurfursten:
  - rscdel: Removed an RNG check that made latejoin traitors and ninjas less common.
  - tweak: Revs will no longer win if Heads flee on the emergency shuttle or pods,
      though they can still secure victory by killing the heads before the shuttle
      lands.
  - tweak: Rev objectives are now more clear that you can exile heads instead of killing
      them.
  - bugfix: Summon guns once again gives guns to all
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug in which the Donutgiver could only be swapped on
  - rscadd: The station is now more multi-chaplain friendly. The game notes all active
      religions instead of just the last chaplain to join, and the library can print
      texts for all of them.
  - rscadd: When joining as chaplain, you will be prompted as to whether you'd like
      the traditional book design and deity of your religion. If the answer is yes

      patron deity)

      faster.
  SonixApache:
  - tweak: The fighting grounds for the Civil War of Casters are creeping ever closer

2019-03-23:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Decades of roaming maintenance tunnels and interacting with its denizens
      have granted janitors the ability to understand the speech of mice and rats.
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: A bunch of broken religion keys, like science, now work
  - rscadd: Objectives can now exist as a delayed type where the target is chosen
      later. Assassinate is delayed 10 minutes for most antags (but not for revolutionaries).
      This means that latejoining within the first 10 minutes is functionally equal
      to being ready at start for roundstart assassinations.
  MadmanMartian:
  - rscadd: Default alternate job option is now return to lobby, rather than get random
      job.
  - bugfix: Fixes preferences breaking

2019-03-24:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: As our player numbers have soared in the past week, Dynamic Mode which
      had been designed to support populations oscillating between 5 and 50 players
      has basically kept picking mode as if we were being permanently at Threat Level
      100, as far as roundstart rulesets are concerned at least. Therefore a new alternative
      configuration has been put in place that puts more weight on the Threat Level,
      and less on the player population, with the goal to bring back some variety
      to our rounds, and less Nuke+Malf+Blob at every or so roundstarts.
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: Loose catbeast antagonists are now black cats.
  MadmanMartian:
  - bugfix: The ghetto space helmets icon states now work
2019-03-26:

      philosophical insights.

      docks, or if it was already docked/traveling to centcom when it was given to
      you.

  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Cultists now have reminders in their notes for the first three runes (Raise
      Structure, Communication, Summon Tome).
  - rscadd: Trying to use a rune before the Act allows it will now also remind cultists
      of their current objective.
  - rscadd: The cup found in cult coffers is now called a tempting goblet. It will
      always refill the blood vessels of cultists drinking blood from it, regardless
      of blood type.
  - rscadd: Non-cultists drinking blood from it however will always get toxins instead,
      as well as suffering from hallucination, red view, jittering, dizziness, and
      a short version of the Confusion rune's effects as well.
  - rscadd: Throwing the goblet will splatter its content on the floor, but if someone
      gets hit by it and their mouth isn't covered, they'll take a gulp first.
  - rscadd: the Raise Structure rune now uses a Radial menu specifying that the Spire
      and Forge are unlocked at Act 1 and 2 respectively.
  - rscadd: Added an admin debug button to easily skip Cult Acts.
  - rscadd: Added some extra info to the cult scoreboard at the end of the round,
      such as the highest count of bloody floors reached.
  - tweak: Asteroid floors, the Vox outpost, vaults or the prison no longer allow
      blood spill progress during Act 3. Sorry Roid cultists.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Shortcut Tracer tattoo HUD icon.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Cult appearing as "successful" on the scoreboard if all its
      current objectives were posthumously completed after the cult had already been
      defeated (such as blood getting spilled after the cult lost)

      oxygen tank to go with it.

      when appearing.
  - tweak: You no longer need harm intent to cut walls with weapons that allow you
      to cut walls (currently melee energy weapons) because the feature was too obscure.
      You still need harm intent for cutting airlocks!
  - tweak: 'Antimov lawset now has a capitalized "must". It looks like this: "MUST".'

  - rscadd: Blacksmithing quality now matters for force, throwforce, and physical
      armors
  - rscadd: Butchering techniques have been developed so that you can butcher vox
      to yield vox meat. We are not sure why this was developed, but it has been.

      console again.

      behaviour. Please report any bug that you encounter.

      nutrients, and generating toxins and eggs. If the food contains mutagen, the
      cockroach might mutate.

      to spawn eggs. 1u of nutriment supports about 2 eggs.
  - tweak: Cockroaches no longer place infinite eggs on trash items. They're now limited
      to 1 egg per turf with trash on it.
2019-03-30:
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: Walking into airlocks while brain-damaged now has a chance to make you
      headbutt it, the same as clicking it.

      crawl if you're knocked down by pain.
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: You can no longer use mannequins to remove undroppable items
  - tweak: Department accounts lowered to 500 (750 for station account)
  - rscdel: Some accounts can be hidden from accounts database (shoal, slot machines,
      vendors). Attempting to set an ID to use these accounts will cause an error,
      as will trying to set a wrong account number.
  - tweak: Lowered the prices of the most expensive things in cargo that were balanced
      around department accounts
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where Cargo was the department attached to public vending
      machines instead of the (unused) vendor account. This means Cargo can't set

      bank account (mostly trader relevant)

      toxic farts, resistance to alcohol, turning into a skeleton, and setting yourself
      on fire) have been properly labeled as superpowers, even if immolate still sets
      you on fire, but at least you can do it intentionally!"'
  - tweak: The melting superpower (the one that turns you into a skeleton) now uses
      a cooldown of 20 seconds instead of 100 charges (that get consumed even when
      it fails because you are a skeleton).
  - tweak: The farsight genetic power is now a toggle ability, in case you didn't
      want your overlays to be ruined indefinitely and the like.
  - spellcheck: Fixed a typo for the description of cryokinesis superpower.

2019-04-08:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Holy Water behaving on cultists as if it had been splashed on then
      as well as ingested when they drink it. Mostly, this means that drinking holy
      water won't cause cultists to visibly jitter before Act 2, as intended (they
      still stutter from Act 1 onwards).
  - bugfix: Fixed the Unholy Protection tattoo not protecting you at all from holy
      water being splashed upon you.
  - bugfix: Stuff that protects you from chemical smokes (aka, plastic bags on head
      and lit cigarettes) now protects cultists as well from holy incense.

  - bugfix: Fixes secure safe UI not updating
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: MoMMI lawset has been reworded. Enforcement of MoMMI behavior should remain
      unchanged, the wording is just more in line with how it's actually enforced.
  MadmanMartian:
  - rscadd: If enabled by the host. If somebody takes enough instantaneous burn damage,
      they will turn to dust, leaving their belongings behind.

      a gigawatt of charge
