      use. However, actually managing to match the template's expected result is up
      to your ability and resources.
  adacovsk:

      weapons that you can block with was not counting as a shield itself.

      one-handed. It also blocks less often.

      items.
  - tweak: 'Containers such as crates, backpacks or boxes will be opened and have
      their contents dumped out for further sorting. This is recursive: A box in a
      backpack will be taken out of it, and then have it''s contents dumped out so
      it can all be sorted and recycled.'
  - tweak: 'Crates and closets that can''t be opened (eg: welded or locked shut) will
      be considered by the sorter as not recyclable, and won''t be sorted into the
      recycler''s conveyor. If you''ve ever experienced a clogged recycling because
      of a locked crate, this should help alleviate that.'

      are now recyclable too.

  - tweak: 'Improves upon the painting template import system: Newer templates will
      now specify width and height when exported, and templates that specify a width
      will be able to be used on any canvas size. Any older templates will still work,
      but will need to be updated to use them outside the canvas size they were originally
      meant for. Add "w":[width] to the template, or if you can''t figure it out,
      just import, paint, and export again.'
