  Probe:
  - rscadd: (Meta)Added a deskbell to cargo.
  - tweak: (Meta)Adjusted the singlo containment field to prevent silly stuff.
  - tweak: (Meta)Replaces the invulnerable shuttle window on Security Escape Pod with
      a full compliment of reinforced plasma windows.  This opens up a way into security,
      but is more secure than the windows in perma.
  Probe1:
  - rscadd: Adds the Arnold Palmer, a non alcoholic drink made from 1 part tea and
      1 part lemonade.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Trees may be cut down with sharp and big enough objects, yielding from
      3 to 8 big logs.
  - rscadd: Trees fall in a random direction when chopped down. Standing in a large
      tree's way is a sure way to get some broken bones, and you can see the direction
      in which the tree is going to fall before it's cut down.
2015-12-07:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: You can now lock conveyor belt switches to one direction only by using
      a multitool on them. You can also unlock roundstart ones to work in both directions,
      because why not, you could already do it by deconstructing and reconstructing
      the switch anyways.
  Pomf123:
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to pick up dionae that are buckled to something such
      as wheelchairs or the janicart which lead to hilarious teleportation antics.
2015-12-08:
  Exxion:
  - rscadd: Light replacer has been completely overhauled. It now actually contains
      storage for lights and storage for waste lights, which it automatically picks
      up. It can be loaded the same way as before or by removing its box and replacing
      that. It ONLY accepts light bulb/tube boxes. The rest should be self-explanatory
      from its menu (accessed by clicking it in your hand).
  - tweak: The material costs of most types of lights have been changed slightly.
      Standard tubes are the same, bulbs are half as much, and the HE variants require
      three times more glass (but not iron) than their standard counterparts. Also,
      the large tube and fire bulb were adjusted, but you almost never see them anyway.
      Even the most expensive light is still a small fraction of a sheet of each,
      though.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added brass knuckles and spiked knuckles. When worn as gloves, they slightly
      increase punch damage and knockout chance. However, they reduce your dexterity,
      making it necessary to remove them for operating computers and some machinery.
  - rscadd: Brass knuckles may be purchased by traitors for 1 TC, spiked knuckles
      may be found in the smooth operator syndicate bundle.
2015-12-10:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Sleepers, DNA scanners, Body scanners, and Cryo pods now allow patients
      to have "abiotic" items in their hands. Items that get trapped inside the machine
      (dropped by the patient while inside) will just get ejected together with the
      patient.
2015-12-12:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed Poly not learning from hearing people, and thus only ever saying
      his default lines.
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to electrolyze Silicate.
  - bugfix: Mann's Drink is now properly counted as a soda can for the purpose of
      IEDs and electrolyzing.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added hardcore mode that can be enabled by admins during (or before) a
      round. When enabled, starvation has many more side-effects than usually (including
      death).
  - tweak: Sleeping humans lose nutrition 75% slower.
2015-12-13:
  9600bauds:
  - experiment: Massive rework to Botany mutations and Botany in general. PLEASE remember
      to use the in-game reporter for any bugs/issues you encounter! The changes here
      are not final and feedback is appreciated.
  - spellcheck: 'This changelog is a very simplified version, it does not cover all
      the changes. To see the full changelog, check out the PR in Github: https://github.com/d3athrow/vgstation13/pull/6734'
  - rscadd: Added 6 new plant traits, as well as many new non-stat mutations. A few
      plant traits that could previously only be obtained through Cargo exotic seeds
      can now also be obtained through mutations.
  - experiment: Some mutations will have effect on the grown fruit and require special
      handling. If you see a mutant banana lying around on the hallway, you may want
      to examine it before touching it.
  - tweak: Botany stat mutations will no longer give random stat penalties. All stat-related
      changes from mutations are now strictly positive.
  - rscadd: 'For stat-increasing mutations, the strength of the mutation will be directly
      proportional to the amount of mutage used. Example: 10u mutagen will improve
      a stat twice as much as 5u would. Mutations are now 100% guaranteed for any
      amount of mutagen, just that small amounts will give weak mutations.'
  - rscadd: 'New mutation system adds a bit of depth to mutagen usage: Using more
      than 10-ish units of mutagen at a time will give you potentially dangerous effects.'
  - tweak: As you improve your plants, they will start to build up resistance to small
      mutagen doses. Past a certain point, you may experience diminishing returns
      from mutations, and you may want to use bigger dosage (though be wary of the
      potential for dangerous results!)
  - experiment: Adult plants WILL NO LONGER MUTATE SPECIES. To cause species mutations,
      you need to add mutagen to a young plant (less than 60ish seconds of life).
      For a better explanation, see the full changelog.
  - tweak: Robust Harvest no longer temporarily increases yield. Now gradually improves
      your plant's potency stat, with a couple subtle downsides. Diethylamine now
      makes your plant grow faster, as well as gradually increase it's lifespan an
      endurance. Clonexadone massively heals plants on trays, as well as induce rapid
      reverse aging.
  - rscadd: Floral Somatorays now work 100% of the time. You can now right-click them
      to change the strength of the ensuing mutation when set to "Induce Mutations"
      (X mutation strength is equivalent to X units of mutagen). Now sometimes give
      a free yield-increasing mutation when under "Induce Mutations" mode.
  - rscadd: Hydroponics Trays will now change their name to match the plant growing
      in them. You can now label trays by right-clicking them.
  - tweak: Improper plant conditions (not enough water/nutriment/light etc) will now
      slightly slow your plant's growth.
  - tweak: A few changes to Exotic Seeds to make them slightly healthier and slightly
      more fun.
  - tweak: 'Spreading plants (i.e. Kudzu) will no longer leave an empty tray when
      planted. Now require being fully mature before spawning vines. You can prevent
      vines from spawning by keeping the plant fed: Kudzu won''t try to spread unless
      it has less than 80% nutriment and water.'
  - tweak: Plant-b-Gone used as a spray now targets space vines in a 3x3 area around
      itself. Scythes now have a 1 second cooldown when used. Added a Heavy-Duty Pneumatic
      Scythe, can be attached to Ripleys. Some strains of Kuzdu can become resistant
      to certain types of damage through mutations.
  - rscadd: 'Xenobotany gene injector now has two modes: Splice and Purge. Added two
      more Xenobotany genes, and modified existing ones somewhat.'
  - tweak: Condensed Capsaicin now requires Capsaicin and Ethanol to produce.
  - tweak: IV Drips now give their increased transfer speed to any container that
      has only blood inside, rather than only IV bags.
  Kurfurst:
  - tweak: Getmore foods are now valued at price = 66% * nutrition value (e.g. SOS
      Jerky has 6u nutriment, so it costs $60). Syndiecakes remain free.
  - tweak: Dan foods are valued at 16.5% * nutrition value. Overall, they became cheaper.
  - tweak: Bustanuts remain free, but no longer contain nutriment. A good source of
      salt and hardcores.
  - tweak: Ramen costs much less than its nutrition value ($15) but has limited stock.
      Dan ramen is less filling but proportionally cheaper ($2)
  - tweak: Cargo Pizza now costs $15 per pizza, so a full pack of five costs $75.
      (Together, they will provide 150-250 nutriment, a value of ~$2000)
  - rscadd: You can now hack Discount Dan machines to buy antitox pills.
  - tweak: Flour sacks by default now contain 50u flour.
  - rscadd: The food processor can butcher toxic meats to carefully remove the toxin
      sacs.
  - rscadd: New items containing poison within poisonous meats. Butcher them out!
  - tweak: Removed bonus poison from cooked poisonous dishes. Meaning if you butcher
      out the poison from the components, the final result will not be toxic.
  - tweak: Most carp dishes now include pheromones as a bonus
  - rscadd: Added a new alcoholic beverage- Pina Colada
  - rscadd: Added several new food items- Rice ball, Risotto, Sushi, Chicken Tendies,
      Coleslaw, Honey Flan
  - rscadd: Firing a pneumatic cannon loaded with food at a person will cause them
      to take a bite if it hits.
  - rscadd: Tea purchased at a machine now comes in one of several thrilling varieties.
  - rscadd: Hacking a Boozeomat will now unlock coffee and mug options.
  - rscadd: The reagent scanner now also tells the exact number of units of each component.
      Scan your food and find out what's worth cooking!
  - tweak: Removed Vending Delay from the Boozeomat, as it was intended for machines
      with an animated vending sprite.
2015-12-14:
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: added a snow turf for use in mapping which has a bunch of cool shite like
      -40c unsimulated and a snow noise but can't be arsed to elaborate more
  - rscadd: added campfires, fireplaces & stoves. if you walk over a campfire you
      get set on fire. they act as heaters which rely on wood, and you can warm your
      hands on them.
  - rscadd: added a spit to roast food on, just have over a lit campfire and hit it
      with food to rotisserie it.
  - imageadd: thanks to Nienhaus for snow sprites and the new wooden door sprite.
  - imageadd: thanks to DragonBro/Bad_Spriter for snow paths.
  - imageadd: thanks to Eliminator for fireplaces, spits, & campfires.
  - imageadd: thanks to Niggly for stoves.
2015-12-16:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Fixed the "Space Travel Gear" button in the Sandbox menu giving you empty
      jetpacks, and upgraded the spacesuit that you get from said button to a NASA
      voidsuit.
  - tweak: You will now see speech bubbles from people who are speaking inside mechs,
      lockers, and generally everything.
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to wipe Xenobotany disks while they were inside a machine.
  - bugfix: Fixed Xenobotany machines having wrong part requirements for building.
  Blithering:
  - imageadd: Added a stormtrooper outfit & blaster
  - rscadd: Added a security-to-stormtrooper modifier which turns lasers & sec hardsuits
      into their stormtrooper equivalent.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added \"assembly frames\", items that allow creating more advanced things
      with assemblies like timers, signallers and speakers. They can hold any amount
      of assemblies inside, and the assemblies inside can be connected together.
  - rscadd: Assembly frames can be found in vendomats (costing one coin), or created
      with protolathes. Each mechanic's locker starts with two assembly frames.
  - rscadd: Added addition circuit assemblies. Whenever they receive a pulse their
      internal counter is increased by 1. Whenever their counter reaches a specified
      value, it resets and the assembly emits a pulse.
  - rscadd: Added randomizer circuit assemblies. When pulsed, they randomly select
      a specified amount of assemblies connected to them, and emit a pulse to them.
  - rscadd: Added comparison circuit assemblies. When pulsed, they check the first
      assembly connected to them. If the condition is true, they emit a pulse to the
      second connected assembly, otherwise they emit a pulse to the third connected
      assembly.
  - rscadd: All of the new assemblies can be made with autolathes.
  - tweak: Timers and proximity sensors now start or stop countdown when pulsed.
  - tweak: It's now possible to set \"default time\" on timers and proximity sensors.
      When their timers finish counting down, the time remaining is reset to the default
      time.
2015-12-17:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: RPDs will now create pipes in the layer and the direction that the RPD
      was set to when the pipe started building, rather than when it finishes. This
      means you can effectively place multiple pipes in different layers and different
      directions at the same time.
  - tweak: Asteroid mobs can now be damaged by sufficiently powerful Pneumatic Cannon
      shots (and, presumably, really strong throws)
  - rscadd: The Tile painter will now paint tiles with the decal that the Tile painter
      was set to when the tile started painting, rather than when it finishes. This
      means you can effectively paint multiple tiles at once with different decals,
      though always within the same category.
  - sounddel: Less annoying and less LOUD sound for the Tile painter.
  - rscadd: Added pocket sand.
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: When suiciding with a gun, a sad song will play in your immediate area.
2015-12-19:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed harmbatons and potentially other attacks not working properly.
  Clusterfack:
  - rscadd: Emotes can now be seen inside objects, thanks saycode optimizations!
  - bugfix: Hologram pads will also be able to see emotes for the AI now
2015-12-20:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Probably fixes a critical bug related to force-feeding people that resulted
      in invisible food sticking to your hand, as well as allowing for the potential
      of infinite slipping and infinite runtimes.
2015-12-25:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Cleanbots will now clean most types of cleanable decals (the kind of shit
      you clean off the floor with soap), rather than only a few select ones.
  - tweak: By default, Cleanbots won't clear crayon drawing or graffiti. They can
      be set to do so by touching their controls.
  - bugfix: Fixed some nanoUI machines displaying a buffering icon and not responding
      for a couple of seconds after pressing a button on their interface. If the problem
      still persists in some machines I didn't see, please don't hesitate to make
      a bug report.
  - rscadd: The Sound Synthetizer now uses a popup list to choose between sounds.
  - soundadd: Tweaked some Sound Synthetizer sounds that were particularly hard to
      hear to make them a bit louder. Also disabled random pitch in a couple of Synthetizer
      sounds that normally do not have randomized pitch, so they sound a little more
      closer to the real deal.
  - soundadd: Added 4 sounds to the Sound Synthetizer, each one more annoying than
      the last, at least two of which may have comedic potential.
  - bugfix: Probably fixed Kudzu being a little buggy when killed extremely fast,
      such as with a chemsprayer.
  - rscadd: Updated the exotic seed random reagents to have weighted randomness for
      some reagents.
  - tweak: Advanced slime mutation toxin is now very rare in exotic seeds. Slime mutation
      toxin and slime jelly are now less common, as well.
  - tweak: Added Methylin, Dexalin Plus, Carp Pheromones, Mint and nothing as possible
      exotic seed reagents.
  - tweak: Un-snowflaked Ambrosia Cruciatus. This means that it's now possible to
      splice Spiritbreaker into other plants through Xenobotany, however, exotic seeds
      that produce Cruciatus leaves won't have Spiritbreaker anymore.
  ArthurDentist:
  - rscadd: Borer eggs can now be ordered from Cargo. Each egg crate contains 1 egg,
      costs 100 credits and requires Xenobiology access to open.
  Clusterfack:
  - bugfix: Heist works now, the objectives and not ending immediately upon sending
      the shuttle
  DeadPoolJ:
  - rscadd: Added a new core module board, CELTIC, which has one law, Be someone the
      crew can look up to and respect.
  Doobiedoo23:
  - rscadd: Adds a few sets of medieval armour, including crusader armour to the chaplains
      arsenal. Deus vult!
  - rscadd: Adds a crate to cargo under the security section allowing you to order
      knight armor
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: You can now construct wood lattices on snow and roid turfs as well as
      make wooden girders and platings.
  - rscadd: Wizards can now choose a santa wizard kit on christmas day only with a
      good deal of nice spells to use.
  Intigracy:
  - rscadd: You can now implant any carbon mob (this means no simple animals like
      corgis, but works on xenos) with implants. These do NOT show up on sechuds unless
      they are human, however.
  - rscadd: Implants now correctly transfer when you change between monkey/human (including
      changeling transform). This has been in the code forever but was not functional
      because monkeys couldn't be implanted.
  - rscadd: The above also applies for diona nymphs evolving into fullblown diona.
  - rscadd: Slimes who split will have the implant be in the one that gets (or would
      get) the mind of the splitter.
  - rscadd: Xenomorph's who are implanted will keep the implant through every stage
      of evolution.
  - bugfix: You can no longer cause items to delete by trying to pick them up while
      you're transforming into a insert mob other than human here.
  - tweak: You can't implant a traitor implant into someone who's loyalty implanted
      without first removing the loyalty implant. Pretty sure this was intended already,
      as it was checking twice for the same implant.
  - bugfix: You can now ventcrawl as normal even if you've got a borer inside of you.
  Kurfurst:
  - rscadd: Added a built in radio to the AI that has a captain level encryption key.
  N3X15:
  - rscadd: Santa can now turn people into coal golems.  They are adamantine golems,
      except made out of coal, and are autoslaved to Santa.
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: 3 new mobs for wintery or christmas bus, polar bear, snow crab (Celts
      suggestion) and gingerbread man (Thread suggestion).
  - rscadd: Assorted festive clothing (3 christmas jumpers, 2 santa hats)
  - rscadd: A crate for festivities (Said christmas jumpers and hats, gift wrapping
      paper, and a cracker)
  - rscadd: Added a sprite for the christmas cracker hat, and relocated it from christmas.dm
      to head/misc.dm
  SonixApache:
  - rscadd: New secHUD icons for mechanics, paramedics, IAA, incarcerated inmates
  - rscadd: 12mm ammobox, empty 9 and 12mm magazines protolathe options
  - rscadd: more empty magazine types
  - bugfix: HoP can now assign IAA agents properly
  - bugfix: Empty magazines now appear empty on creation
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added cockroaches that can spawn during the vermin infestation event.
      They are resilent, but weak to toxins (in form of smoke or sprays). They also
      lay eggs under food.
  - tweak: Animals are now slightly damaged by acid sprays or smoke.
  - tweak: Tiny animals like mice and cockroaches no longer drop gibs when butchered.
  - rscadd: Added math circuits. Usable in assembly frames, they possess a wide range
      of mathematical functions and can process both constant values (numbers) and
      variable values (other assemblies, for example timers)
  - rscadd: Added read-write circuits. Usable in assembly frames, they can read, store
      and modify values of various assemblies
  - experiment: Both of the new assemblies can be printed using the autolathe
  - tweak: Reworked comparison circuits. Order in which assemblies are connected to
      them no longer matters, and both sides of the equation can be variable or constant
  - tweak: Assemblies in assembly frames can be pulsed by clicking on an uppercase
      P next to them
  - tweak: Voice analyzers may be muted by hitting them with a multitool. They also
      are no longer triggered by sounds coming from assembly frames.
2015-12-27:
  Zth:
  - soundadd: Added few sounds
2015-12-28:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Added Choco-Coins, available in Getmore's vending machines, or can be
      made with one chocolate bar and 5 milk at a microwave.
  - imageadd: Choco-Coin sprites courtesy of a generous Anon in the general.
  Intigracy:
  - rscadd: Slimes now keep their names when they evolve or split.
  - rscdel: Slimes are no longer named baby or adult due to the above. If you can't
      tell the difference you can examine the slime instead.
  N3X15:
  - rscadd: Added blattogenesis effect to viruses.
2015-12-29:
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added light tile remotes - devices that can remotely change colour and
      state of light tiles. They're compactible with assemblies and assembly frames,
      and can be built by protolathes.
  - rscadd: Up to five assemblies can be connected to the atmos automation console.
      Connected assemblies can be activated using the Assembly - Pulse command.
2015-12-30:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Added tech levels to many common items, so that they can be scanned with
      the Device Analyser. Notorious additions are PDA cartridges, Laser Tag equipment,
      Hookshots, Straightjacket/Muzzle/Blindfold, Pill collectors, Hailers, Modkits,
      and Shoulder holsters.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - experiment: Added meteor types. All sorts of fun new meteors might spawn depending
      on wave type, with special effects
  - bugfix: Fix meteor spawning proc causing some meteors to hit Z-level transition,
      and causing small waves to be 60 % smaller than intended
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: People who are turned into statues and shattered are now gibbed instead
      of turned to dust.
  TheEliminator16:
  - rscadd: Added a new child of bear called "Skrite". Adminbus only mob that hits
      like a bear and is twice as tough as one. Skrites move considerably slower than
      bears, on account of having only one leg, but make up for it with a toxic projectile
      attack.
  - imageadd: Added skrite sprites to animal.dmi
  - imageadd: Added skrite sprites to animal.dmi (used the correct animal.dmi this
      time, sorry niggly, I fucked your pudding)
  Unid:
  - tweak: When reading a newscaster, clicking on a photo will show you its description
2015-12-31:
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: Borers now transfer when their host is transformed. Depending on the new
      mob they become, you might be dropped. For admin transformations you always
      get dropped.
  - tweak: Mobs with borers in them are no longer immune to the staff of change.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added superglue. It can be applied to any item to make it unable to be
      dropped. Undroppable items can't be put in machines, thrown or dropped. However,
      they can still be eaten, disassembled or (in case of stacks) separated.
  - rscadd: Clown and mime traitors may purchase a bottle of superglue (one time use)
      for 3 telecrystals.
2016-01-01:
  DeadPoolJ:
  - rscadd: Made a new admin verb, Send Fax, which lets admins send a fax without
      having to reply to one first.
  - rscadd: Made faxes and prayers show up in the special window if admins have it
      enabled.)
  Dylanstrategie:
  - bugfix: Chemistry has been broken for nineteen days, so badly that you couldn't
      splash reagents on people, objects or turfs. Nineteen fucking days, and it took
      Sarah fucking Johnson to come back from the dead to report it
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Subjugation no longer lasts for upwards of 10 minutes. It now lasts 3 minutes
      per cast.
  Unid:
  - tweak: Animals can only be butchered on help intent now.
2016-01-02:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Combat messages (X has attacked Y with Z) will now show up in a bigger
      font for the player that was hit. For now this only applies to most melee attacks,
      if you come across a message that you feel should be made bigger for the affected
      player, don't hesitate to make an in-game report.
  - tweak: External blood loss has been slowed by 25%, though you'll still lose roughly
      the same amount of blood.
  - rscadd: Lying down will reduce the amount of blood you lose from external bleeding
      by 30% (This goes a longer way than it sounds). If you can't stop the bleeding,
      your best bet is to lie down and call for help or have someone drag you.
  - tweak: Tweaked low blood level warnings to give a little of a warning transition
      between "mostly fine" and "going into shock".
  - tweak: Slightly tweaked the effect of low blood levels, previously medium blood
      loss would be deadlier than heavy blood loss. It will still kill you pretty
      dead.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - rscadd: Singularity Beacons now have an internal battery. It will last one minute,
      which allows you to either set up a quick beacon without wires, or continue
      dragging when the Singularity knocks out the powernet
  - rscadd: The Singularity Beacon now glows red when on. This means it will be far
      less concealable in darkness, and shouldn't be adjacent to a wall (due to the
      way lighting works)
  - tweak: Singularity Beacons now needs to be wrenched down instead of screwed down.
      Cable is connected on hand interaction (interact again to turn on and off) and
      disconnected by wrenching or unwrenching
  - tweak: Singularity Beacons now need 500 W/s to run, and actually drain that amount
      from the grid
2016-01-03:
  ArthurDentist:
  - rscadd: Added a new artifact which can be found through xenoarcheology
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Double Agents will no longer be given the die a glorious death objective.
      Instead they have a chance to get the escape alone objective.
  Wizardcrying:
  - tweak: Viruses no longer mutate their effects when their host catches some radiation.
      This change actually dates back to Nov. 10, 2015, but it was never added to
      the changelog until now.
2016-01-04:
  Duny:
  - rscadd: Added a borer egg and a plasma canister to xenobiology. Two portable air
      scrubbers have also been added in xenobiology maintenance.
  - bugfix: Fixed glass doors on the derelict not being dense.
  - bugfix: Fixed solar APCs not charging.
  - rscadd: Added a coin press to the asteroid.
  - tweak: Modified the morgue's layout, more trays and less empty space.
  - tweak: Fixed up a bit the walls and rwalls around science to be more nanotrasen-approved.
  - rscadd: Added a light switch to hydrophonics.
  - bugfix: Fixed Mechanics Workshop vent not being connected to anything.
  - tweak: Added a few additional lights in science to make the hallway less spooky
      when one breaks.
  - bugfix: Attached the floating camera in xenobio to the wall.
  - rscadd: Added two cyborg analyzers to robotics.
  - rscadd: Added plant clippers in xenobotany.
  - rscadd: Added compressed matter cartridges in the bar storage, and replaced the
      shotgun with a double-barreled model.
  - tweak: Tweaked the starting charge of the SMES cells again. Might or might not
      be adequate since I still can't use SMES cells or APCs or anything else so I
      can't test it properly.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - tweak: Change Syndicate ammo box to contain a loaded speedloader, instead of an
      empty speedloader and an ammo box (with as many bullets)
2016-01-05:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Unsnowflaked Godblunts. This means that they will now have exactly the
      same reagents the plant had, nothing more.
  - bugfix: Fixed botany nonsense that could result in negative mols of a gas.
  - bugfix: Hopefully fixed the Reverse Engine and General Fabricator bugging out
      with any items that could be created in the Protolathe. There's a chance I've
      fucked this up, so if you notice any subsequent bugs please don't hesitate to
      use the in-game bug reporter.
  PJB3005:
  - experimental: 'Made map voting weight-based: if box got 75% of the votes, meta
      10% and deff 15%, those chances will be used to pick the map.'
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Light tiles now emit colored light
  - bugfix: Fixed newscasters eating photos
2016-01-06:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Ghosts can now read books by examining them when close enough. Ghosts
      can now also click a bookcase to read the books that are inside (without removing
      them from the bookcase).
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a reagent container (i.e. beaker) while it's in your inventory
      will now directly bring up the \"Set transfer amount\" menu.
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a Chemistry Dispenser will now directly eject it's beaker,
      if any.
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a portable scrubber or portable pump will now eject their
      held tank, without having to open their menu.
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a washing machine will now start it. Likewise for Centrifuges.
  - rscadd: Janicarts have now gained a \"Remove Trash Bag\" verb. Alt-clicking a
      Janicart will directly remove it's trash bag. Clicking a Janicart while you're
      riding it will no longer bring up a popup asking what you want to do, it will
      instead always make you stop riding it. If you want to remove the trash bag
      while riding it, use the verb or alt-click.
  - experiment: If you can think of any other alt-click shortcuts that you'd like
      to see in the game, please don't hesitate to write a letter, stamp it, and mail
      it to my house, but don't make a feature request or people other than me will
      have to read it, which gets them mad cranky.
2016-01-07:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: If a fruit naturally produces than 100 units of a chemical, it will now
      try to fraction the chemicals into 100 units, rather than discard the overflow.
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to dilute hydroponics tray toxicity by using water.
  - bugfix: Fixed General Fabricator not working with certain items (again), probably
      fixes General Fabricator trying to use acid when making circuitboards.
2016-01-09:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Diona pods now start with 35 durability. This means that they won't immediately
      die as soon as the lights are turned off or the tray gets weeds or something
      similar. This also means that, due to popular vote, Diona seeds are easily attainable
      by using plant clippers.
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: Adds the ability for ghosts to jump into borers with no ckey assigned.
      Just click on them as a ghost to check, but you do need to not have the spawnban
      from ghosting
2016-01-10:
  ArthurDentist:
  - rscadd: Added Eucharist Wafers which can be made in the microwave with 5 holy
      water and 5 flour. Seven also exist in the Chaplain's Vendor.

      now automatically stack with each other (so harvesting from a tray with glass
      yields one stack with 5 grass tiles)
  xpcybic:
  - wip: The following changes apply to Taxistation.
  - tweak: Taxi docks are now U-shaped and have two entrances each.
  - tweak: Slightly enlarged cargo bay QM office, custodial closet, dorms, hydroponics,
      kitchen, bar, tool storage, atmos, pod bay, brig, toxins, xenobio, xenobotany,
      and head of staff offices.
  - rscadd: Added jetpacks in EVA, engi/cargo EVA, and engineering.

  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed stackable items (metal rods, floortiles etc) only giving one item's
      worth of materials when recycled at an Autolathe, regardless of how many items
      there were in the stack. Also fixes metal rods and possibly more items having
      the same bug or not working at all in the Recycler. Given that this had been
      broken for over half a year with seemingly no reports, I'm obliged to say once
      again that if you notice anything weird with this fix, you should make an in-game
      bug report.
2016-01-18:
  Kurfurst:
  - bugfix: Extinguishers once again properly calm the heart of a rabid slime
2016-01-19:

2016-01-22:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed nested storage items (e.g. a box inside a backpack) closing their
      inventory when you move, even if you were holding the parent storage item.
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to use screwdrivers as ghetto surgery tools.
  - tweak: Added an error message when trying to use surgery to fix a bone fracture
      in a very damaged limb. This is to prevent the \"bone explodes immediately after
      being mended\" syndrome.
  - tweak: Will no longer place items on operating tables, which was really annoying
      because it would end up in accidentally dropping your surgery tools under the
      patient. If you really want to place an item on top of the operating table for
      some reason, you can throw it on top instead.
2016-01-23:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed trays not picking up items. Fixed trays not removing their items
      when dropped or thrown. Fixed trays picking up items bigger than w_class = 3.
      Also fixed trays picking up trays. Also fixed a tray-related gamebreaking exploit
      that allowed you to permanently delete the nukedisk. Also fixed a tray-related
      gamebreaking exploit that allowed you to put any item inside a backpack, including
      other backpacks, and load a backpack past it's maximum storage slots. These
      things were really broken, weren't they?
  xpcybic:
  - wip: The following changes apply to Metaclub.

  - rscadd: Added a newscaster to tcomms control room, for easy AI access.

2016-01-24:
  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Cult objectives and stuff should work fine in Mixed mode now. Might require
      some live testing so please give feedback at github.com/d3athrow/vgstation13/pull/7813
      if you end up in a Mixed cult round.
  - bugfix: Fixed new blood splatters not properly replicating the DNA of other blood
      splatters on their same turfs unless the round is cult.

  DrCelt:
  - experiment: SUMMARY
  - rscadd: Heat transfer Rehaul
  - rscadd: Hypothermia added
  - rscadd: changes to things that cause cold damage
  - rscadd: space blankets
  - rscadd: ghetto space suits with space blankets
  - rscadd: thermal homeostasis regulator that when emagged becomes the mancrowave
  - tweak: changes to cryo
  - experiment: INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HEAT TRANSFER
  - tweak: removes useless variables heat_protection & cold_protection as these were
      in 99% of circumstances the exact same as body_parts_covered
  - rscadd: added a new variable, heat_conductivity to all items, determining how
      fast they conduct heat away from you
  - rscadd: added new procs to humans, sweat() & burn_calories() - Now whenever you
      use up nutriment, you generate heat, but can also expend nutriment to decrease
      heat.
  - rscadd: refactored how heat transfer away from humans worked ( see above)
  - experiment: INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HYPOTHERMIA
  - rscadd: added Mild Hypothermia (between 32 and 35C) - this results in shivering,
      minor slowdown and messages informing the player that they are cold.
  - rscadd: added Moderate hypothermia (between 28 and 32C) - Shivering stops, slowdown
      increases, may slur/stutter words, chance of dropping items in hand and collapsing
      temporarily, as well as a 25% chance of forgetting how to use machines like
      when braindamaged
  - rscadd: added severe hypothermia (24 to 28C), shivering stops, player is unconcious,
      pulse decreases to 30BPM and has a 25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, which
      decreases over time as you are still breathing.
  - rscadd: added profound hypothermia (less than 24C), pulse stops, player has a
      25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, does not decrease over time as they are
      not breathing.
  - tweak: CHANGES THINGS WHICH CAUSE COLD DAMAGE, including but not limited to coldingtons,
      cryokinesis, showers, goliaths, temperature gun, and chemicals which chill people.
      Foam fire extinguishers are not affected.
  - experiment: THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR
  - experiment: Please use this when taking someone out of cryo
  - tweak: When a person is dragged in, it will automatically begin stabilising, there
      is no need for more buttons to be pressed
  - tweak: Takes 5 seconds to heat/cool someone to 37C, which works out as quicker
      than shaking someone up.
  - rscadd: Can be emagged to allow for three extra settings - this process is extremely
      visible, and there is a different sprite for when an emagged function is used
  - rscadd: Can reenable security features to quickly unemag the device and Can bring
      the device to an emergency stop.
  - experiment: CHANGES TO CRYO
  - tweak: Cryo now releases someone at 23C instead of -12C (or 25C if they manually
      eject)
  - experiment: PLEASE USE THE THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR AFTER TAKING PEOPLE OUT
      OF CRYO
  - tweak: Manual eject time brought down from 2 minutes to 30 seconds to make it
      time-neutral
  - tweak: This means that, as the person is ejected below profound hypothermia, they
      will not breathe until they heat up a wee bit further. This is a positive change,
      as vox & plasmamen will no longer die from toxin damage/fire immediately after
      leaving cryo.
  - rscadd: People inside a cryo cell do not suffer from hypothermia until leaving.
2016-01-26:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: Admins can now specify which modes they want in Mixed (among the modes
      allowed in Mixed)
  - imageadd: Revamped fireplaces.
  - imageadd: Paper bins have a new default sprite. Their sprite is now different
      whether there's a blank paper, a written paper, or a cult talisman on top.
  - rscadd: You can now also read the top paper or identify which talisman (if you're
      a cultist) is on top simply by examining the paper bin.
  Zth:
  - bugfix: Fixed flatpacks dissapearing when unstacking them.
2016-01-28:

      and it were to be destroyed in some manner
2016-02-02:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Better solution to the 'bone explodes immediately after being mended' syndrome.
      You will now once again be able to fix bones no matter the damage level of the
      limb. If the limb is so damaged that it would immediately break again after
      setting the bone, it will now heal to just under bone fracture levels. Note
      that this effectively lets you heal brute damage on dead people.
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: Added a bunch of wiki links for every antag roles in the Character Setup
      window. Also separated actual antag roles from non-antag special roles.
  Sood:

  - rscadd: Added a new human-unique language, Sol Common. (Doesn't actually look
      a thing like Esperanto but that's what it's based off of)

2016-02-04:
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: Merged flags_inv and body_parts_covered
  - bugfix: Fixed clothing being contaminated undesirably
  - bugfix: Fixes a bunch of unreported bugs due to the nature of the PR varying from
      the HoP jacket the riot suit and the stallhelm. If there is a bug where a sprite
      was overriding where it should not have this SHOULD fix that
  - experimental: This SHOULD also prevent that type of bug ever happening again.
      Please bugreport if you notice any sprite errors
  - rscadd: Adds is_slot_hidden proc
  - tweak: Splits head thermal conductivity into three parts
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where agent gas masks would conceal identities when their

      how wrapped up the other limbs are.
2016-02-05:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: When making bottles at a Chemmaster, you will now be prompted to input
      how many bottles you want to make before being prompted to name the bottles.
      This is to keep consistency with making pills (prevent bottles named '3'), and
      also allows the bottles to be automatically named after many units of chemicals
      they contain.
  - rscadd: You can now alt-click Chemmasters and All-in-One Grinders to eject their
      beaker, if they have one loaded.

  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: Adds a noir genetics block which the detective starts roundstart with

  - rscadd: Facehuggers will now acquire targets and walk to them, and hug them when
      they're close enough.
2016-02-09:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Slightly buffed the surgery speed bonuses of advanced surgery tools (laser
      scalpels, surgical incision manager).
  - tweak: Fix-o-Vein, bone gel, and bone setters now have the same size as other
      surgery tools, meaning they now fit in pockets and boxes.
  - tweak: Circular saws and surgical drills no longer fit in pockets or boxes.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Masks do not protect against facehuggers. Wear a face-covering helmet such
      as a RIG helmet or bio hood.
  - experiment: Helmets have a 50% chance to be removed on facehugger attacks. This
      is a temporary balance change, but may stay if it this turns out to be enough.
  - bugfix: Facehugger toys will not forcefully remove headgear or path on their own.
      They will still leap at you if you walk next to them though.

2016-02-12:
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: Had to hand in my Pull Request to the Chief - He'd always had it out for
      me, and the code ain't ever been in my favour, not since the war anyway. I looked
      it all over once more, tryin' to get to the bottom of this mystery, but it ain't
      easy finding bugs in some downtrodden code like this.I thought of that paddy
      dame that showed up in my office last week, asking for me to help her. Said
      someone called 'Gene Ettics' went AWOL. I told her I'd do what I could, and
      that's why I'm here. I opened up my flask of brandy and took a sip. It was going
      to be a long night. Chief or no chief, I'm getting to the bottom of this case.
  - rscadd: Re-adds the Noir Block.
  Pomf123:

  TheEliminator16:
  - rscadd: Added the "Hostile Infestation" event. Similar to the normal infestation
      event, though this time with hostile mobs

      to send meteors without a command report. I'm sure this will never be abused,
      ever.
  - rscadd: Added "Organic Debris Field" event. Similar to meteors except instead
      of killing everyone, it splatters the outside of the station with gore, body
      parts, organs, exploding corpses...

      for less than a minute.

  - rscadd: Adds a space-worthy exploration suit only for greys. Sprites courtesy
      of Niggly.

      hit by polyacid can finally get a replacement helmet and such.
  xpcybic:

  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed a very bizzare bug that could result in humans (especially lings,
      monkeymen, and head transplanted players) having TWO different blood types,
      each one of them only used for certain things.
  - bugfix: Monkeymen will now properly have randomized blood types.
  - rscdel: Players will now have randomized blood types as well. Random blood types
      follow a weighted distribution. Hopefully this will save Medbay from a lot of
      headaches.
  - experiment: 'The blood type distribution is as follows: 36% O+, 28% A+, 20% B+,
      5% AB+, 4% O-, 3% A-, 1% B-, 1% AB-. This is the same distribution Monkeymen
      were supposed to have, although a bug prevented it from working properly.'
  - rscadd: Your blood type is now added to your character notes when you spawn, in
      case you lose your ID (use the 'notes' verb, IC tab). You can check on other
      people's blood type by examining their ID or using the Medical Records database.
  - rscadd: Added a 'Wake-Up Cycle' option to Sleepers, which will try to wake up
      the occupant. This is intended to work as an alternative to the Mancrowave.
      Alt-clicking a Sleeper while an occupant is inside will automatically start
      this cycle.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Paralysis Summary timer not working properly on Sleepers (this
      will give you an approximation of how long the occupant's paralysis/sleep would
      last if left alone).
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Added the blunderbuss.
  - rscadd: Added the tomahawk.

  Sood:
  - tweak: Wizards now spawn with all organic limbs and internal organs.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added a new, disorienting hallucination effect.

  Unid:
  - rscadd: Baby carps now attack unconscious mobs. When they attack living mobs enough
      times, they grow up.
  - rscadd: Baby carps can be fed by attacking them with meat. Feeding them has a
      slight chance of making them your friend, and will eventually cause them to
      grow up.
  - rscadd: Baby animals now consider their mother's friends their friends. This applies
      to space carps, too

      and coat
2016-02-17:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Cryo cells now pop you out at a safe temperature once again, though just
      cold enough to give you the jitters for a few seconds. However, it takes 4 seconds
      to eject somebody from a Cryo cell. Essentially, the Mancrowave's body heat
      regulation functionality was directly implemented into Cryo.
  - rscadd: Cryo cells now also give a short period of grace to non-oxygen-breathing
      races after being ejected from Cryo, in which they won't breathe (and Plasmamen
      won't combust) so that they may be given internals safely. This is to replace
      the effects of post-cryo Hypothermia, which made people not breathe.
2016-02-19:
  CptWad:
  - rscadd: PBJ's code that makes it so now supermatters not on your z-level exploding

  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: The following changes are to Defficiency
  - rscadd: Ported over metaclubs Centcomm, so ERT and Deathsquad can exist and more
      room for bus
  - rscadd: Added the Vox Skipjack from box, so now Vox Raiders can happen on Defficiency
  - rscadd: Added the salvage shuttle to Z level 6, but as Defficiency is defficient
      of an aux-docking port, it cant dock to the station properly.
  - rscadd: Fixed a piping error in xenobiology, gave it and the research corridor
      some more vents considering the size
  - rscadd: Expanded the xenobotany area on the research outpost. It now also has
      gas-controlled trays (just need to wrench them down)
  - rscadd: Added an autolathe to R&D
  - rscadd: Fixed a few area mishaps (Area in front of the HoPs office that had no
      defined area, areas in the SME room that werent correct)
  - rscadd: Relocated the Mancrowave in medical to somewhere a bit more sensible,
      removed the Sec outpost from medical as it was unused.

  Sood:
  - experiment: 'Deus Ex Update:'
  - tweak: (Deus Ex Update hijacked by Sood from N3X15)
  - rscadd: Lungs are now fully modular and actually process gas for humans.  Lungs
      must be compatible with a species or they will die of suffocation.
  - rscadd: Vox and Plasmamen have their own lungs.
  - rscadd: Most species currently exhale CO<sub>2</sub>.  Vox may be tweaked later
      to exhale N<sub>2</sub>O. Plasmamen exhale oxygen, though.
  - rscadd: Robotics can make Advanced Lungs (programming 2, biomech 4), which are
      compatible with all species and filter out some gasses (N2O and plasma), up
      to certain partial pressures.
  - rscadd: Livers are also modular and can be set to enhance "natural" removal rates
      of reagents. Nothing yet makes any use of this, so all livers are standard UNTIL
      YOU CODE IT.
  - rscadd: Livers which are bruised will deal toxin damage to their owner if the
      user has any toxic reagents in their system. Ethanol with a bruised liver is
      extremely dangerous.
  - rscadd: Livers become damaged over time if their owner has a lot of toxin damage.
      Doctors beware.
  - rscadd: Eyes are modular and Advanced Type 1 eyes can grant enhanced nightvision
      and built-in welder goggles.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added cages. Mobs inside cages can interact with the outside world, unless
      the cage's cover is closed. Alt-clicking a cage will toggle its cover. Cages
      with closed covers can be used to safely transport hostile animals (or assistants).
  - rscadd: Cages can be crafted with 6 plasteel sheets.
2016-02-22:
  Sood:
  - bugfix: Plasmen now react to oxygen and actually need plasma to breathe again.
      Blame N3X for everything it's fine :^)

      and may lag.
2016-02-24:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: 'Fixed electric chairs not working. To prevent confusion, electric chairs
      now start on. To use an electric chair: Screwdriver on electropack, apply helmet,
      use on chair. Activate the electric chair with a remote signaler tuned to the
      electropack''s frequency and code.'
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added boomerangs - heavy throwing weapons that can be crafted from wooden
      planks. When thrown, they fly in an arc around the target and return to your
      hands.
  - tweak: Animal attacks can now be blocked by shields and reactive teleport armour
  - bugfix: Fixed boomerangs spinning forever. Fixed boomerangs doing only a fraction
      of their actual damage on impact
  - bugfix: Fixed some bugs with hostile animals being stored in cages
  Zth:
  - rscadd: SCP-294 added.
2016-02-25:

  Unid:
  - experiment: Added two special attacks - kicks and bites. Players can now select
      their preferred attack type on their HUD (the buttons are next to throw and
      drop). Hotkey for kicking is 5 or CTRL 5. Hotkey for biting is 6 or CTRL 6.
  - experiment: Special attacks proc when clicking something on harm intent. You need
      both of your feet to perform a kick. You need at least two teeth or a beak to
      bite. Kicks have 2x the normal attack delay.
  - tweak: Kicking a vending machine now requires you to enable the Kick special attack.
  - tweak: Kicking a lying human turns the attack into a stomp, dealing double damage.
  - tweak: Kicking a small item sends it flying.
  - tweak: SWAT shoes, combat boots and jackboots increase kick damage. Stomping on
      somebody while wearing magboots deals a lot of damage.
  - tweak: Talons increase kick damage if not wearing shoes. Vox now have talons.
  - rscadd: Vampires have to enable the Bite special attack to drain blood. Vampires
      can bite while wearing masks.
  jeroen52:
  - rscadd: Added a new core module board, HOGAN. Does not spawn in AI Upload at roundstart,
      you need to print this board.
2016-02-28:
  Unid:

  - rscadd: You can now alt-click an IV drip to toggle mode. You can also clickdrag
      unlocked Cloning Pod into the floor to eject it.
  - tweak: Toolboxes now have up to 14 item slots. Much like how plastic bags work,
      they may hold less than 14 items depending on their total combined size.
  - tweak: Toolboxes can now hold many general Engineering items they couldn't hold
      before. This includes material sheets, power cells, floor tiles, metal rods,
      RCD, RPD, tile painter, light replacer, improved welding tools, and the station
      blueprints.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Holy water and bibles can now be used to de-thrall vamp thralls.
  - tweak: Holy water deconversion occurs in on_mob_life, so splashing them with it
      might not be as effective as injecting/ingesting.
  Unid:
  - tweak: The damage spears deal is now affected by the sharpness of the shard used
      to create it
  - tweak: Creation of a spear now takes some time, and can be interrupted
  - tweak: Changed how throwing a glass shard at a wall affects the shard's damage
      (now damage is either randomly increased or decreased)
  Zth:
  - rscadd: Added autist nanites, a disease that turns you into a mommi.
  - rscadd: Added bowl of mommi spaghetti for this disease. Note, this is exactly
      like roburgers but for mommis
2016-03-04:
  TheEliminator16:
  - tweak: Made autocloner spawn things faster in general

      when not being used to heal. They also cure viruses.
  - rscadd: Combat Nanobots act as a downside-free version of creatine.
  - rscadd: Taking too many nanobots at a time has dire consequences.

  - tweak: TEG output is now 4 times lower.
  Sood:
  - bugfix: You can no longer whisper while silence stung/silenced in general.

  - rscadd: You cannot do the following while the link is broken Call the shuttle,
      Recall the shuttle, Fax Central command, Send messages to Central Command, Call
      or Send the Cargo Shuttle
  - rscadd: Recieving normal messages from central command when the link is broken
      will appear gibberish and have a static sound.
  - rscadd: An admin may send an ungibberish message to the crew even when the link
      is broken, but he will be prompted first asking if he is sure.
  - rscadd: Blob alerts ignore whether or not the link with central command is broken
  PJB3005:

  Icantthinkofanameritenow:
  - rscadd: Death Sting now injects cyanide instead of lexorin. Death Sting, DNA Extract
      Sting, and Horror Form all have reduced genome costs.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added morningstars and steel spears. They can be found in xenoarch.
  - rscadd: Added wooden bucklers. They can be crafted with planks, they're much less
      effective than normal shields and they can break after receiving enough damage.
2016-03-11:
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: Paint cans now require you to be standing next to the tile you're trying
      to paint, and take obstacles such as windows into account. RIP lubing through
      walls using XRAY.
2016-03-13:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: All Chemdispensers in Boxstation and Metastation now start with 100 energy,
      like they were intended to.
  - tweak: Busta-Nuts now contain nutriment once again. However, to keep them free,
      they are now a contraband item, and they have a more limited stock.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Boxstation's engineering is now powered directly by the engines instead
      of through the SMES.
  - rscadd: Emagging ED-209s make them laser people.

      a threat for holding floral somatories, hookshots, or defibs.
  - bugfix: Secbot options now properly work. Before, you had to have ID checking
      on for it to check for anything, and it would always check for weapons with
      ID checking on.
  - bugfix: Weapon Permits (the access available from the HoP) now properly function.
      The abovenamed will no longer consider you a threat for having weapons if you
      have the access.
  - tweak: 'Note: Agent Cards lower your threat level by 2 for bots/VALIDs. It takes
      a minimum of 4 for them to arrest/flash you.'
  - tweak: 'Note: Bartenders have always started with a weapons permit.'
  - tweak: Vampires now heal oxy damage inside of coffins, added on top of the brute/burn/toxin
      healing.
  - tweak: Vampires now have their internal organs healed in coffins. You still won't
      replenish blood if you bled it out, and it won't fix broken bones.
2016-03-14:
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Randomly selected structures will now generate somewhere on the map on
      the beginning of each round. Currently there are only 5 structures that can
      be generated, but it's very easy to make more!
2016-03-16:
  9600bauds:
  - tgs: Ported automatic material stacking from TG, full credits to MrPerson. This
      means that some stackable items (such as floortiles, cable coils, metal sheets
      etc) will now try to stack with eachother when they're in the same tile. This
      allows you to, for example, drag a floortile behind yourself to scoop up all
      the loose tiles in a hallway.
  - tweak: Silicate formula now results in 9 units instead of 3.
  Duny:
  - tweak: 'Deff: Re-added the security checkpoint in medbay.'
  - rscadd: 'Deff: Added a few additional air alarms in hallways.'

      the AME horizontally rather than vertically, as AME code is apparently shit
      and will fuck up if built vertically.'
  - rscadd: 'Deff: Added windoors behind plastic flaps in places where simply deconstructing
      plastic flaps would allow anyone to enter.'
  - rscadd: 'Deff: Added a bar of soap in both custodial closets.'
  Intigracy:
  - rscadd: It is now more obvious that you have to emag bots (think floorbots, beepsky,
      ed-209's, cleanbots, every bot ever) twice to get them to behave naughty.
  - experiment: Did you know you have to emag bots twice to make them actually get
      emagged? The first time only unlocks the controls for everyone to use.
  - imageadd: The bunsen burner now has a better sprite.
  - bugfix: Voicechangers can now properly choose the clown mask option to morph into.
  - tweak: 'Pushing someone pulling an occupied rollerbed is now treated like pushing
      someone pulling a prisoner: you can''t.'
  - rscadd: You can now make Universal Enzyme in chemistry using 1 unit each of Blood,
      Nutriment, and Sodium Chloride (salt)
  - tweak: Moonshine is now made with cornoil and universal enzyme instead of nutriment
      and universal enzyme.
  - imageadd: Vines ready to bear fruit have an icon now, instead of the standard
      heavy vine icon.
  - rscadd: You can now burn newspapers, just like you can with papers. Most of the
      properties of paper now apply to newspaper, such as recycling for wood, except
      newspapers deal a miniscule amount of damage when you hit things with them (ever
      been hit by a rolled up newspaper? It hurts.)
  - tweak: Goliaths are more obviously dead when dead.
  - rscadd: In order to break their vow, mimes now have a spell again instead of having
      to emote say *oath. It's still irreversible, and has a prompt just in case you
      don't mean to use it.
  - tweak: Admins can now choose to announce the filename of a sound they play globally.
  - rscadd: Surgeon Switchtool now fits in medical belts.
  - tweak: Changelings can now use ling chat while using regenerative stasis.

  - bugfix: Containment Fields now won't shock you through windows. For an example
      of what this means, see http://tinyurl.com/noshockpls
  - tweak: Showers are now ordered from cargo, not built using metal sheets. They
      also have to be bolted to the floor to turn them on.
  - tweak: You can now use lit pipes as internals, just like you can use lit cigarettes/cigars.
  - rscadd: The RobCo vending machine on the derelict now has atmos analyzers.
  - rscdel: Spacepods now no longer have their own verb tab when you get in. The one
      verb that's added is in the object tab.
  - tweak: Spacepods now only have one verb to enter/exit instead of two seperate
      ones. It's still in both the object tab and right click menu.
  - experiment: You have to wave your hands around to use the Force.
  - rscadd: You can now use TK even with broken hands and won't drop the items. You
      do need hands to use TK though, see above.
  TheEliminator16:
  - tweak: Changed instant death limit of medical nanobots to 20u. 5-20u is a danger
      zone that CAN result in horrors, the likelihood of which increases the more
      damage has been healed while nanobots have been above 5 units.
  - rscadd: Added different species of cyber horror for each playable race (except
      diona, because nanobots have no effect on dionae)
  - tweak: Made cryoxadone turn medical nanobots back into normal ones. This is both
      to discourage use in cryo mixes and act as a way to counteract nanobot overdoses.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added tournament lances - very long spears that are too heavy to use in
      normal combat. When traveling at fast speeds, tournament lances can be couched
      to deliver a devastating blow to anybody standing in your way (damage depends
      on distance traveled).
  - tweak: Tournament lances can be found on the asteroid as xenoarch finds.
  - soundadd: Added a new song to the title screen
  Zealotron:
  - spellcheck: The Duit is now a Suit

      blocked.
  - tweak: AI core SMES is now in its own room south of AI upload and starts fully
      charged.
  - tweak: Security camera in sec/sci bridge now appears first in the camera list,
      like the dock cameras. AIs can jump to this camera for easy access to consoles.
  - rscadd: Added security records and research shuttle consoles to bridge.
  - tweak: Spread out the sleepers, scanner, and mancrowave so that they can be walked
      between.
  - rscdel: Replaced the Mancrowave with a body scanner.
  - tweak: Expanded the IAA office a little bit.
  - rscadd: Added a pAI to sec/sci rec room.

      Click with single round or 357 box of ammo to add a round and spin it. Click
      it in hand to spin it. Target head or mouth and click yourself to try your luck.
      Right click > empty ammo to empty out all the ammunition (including the spent
      casings).
  - tweak: Spent casings are now named as such to make retrieving unspent ammunition
      from a pile easier.

      from 5 metal sheets, just like a machine frame.'
  - imgadd: Conveyor belt assembly sprites courtesy of Blithering.
  - rscadd: Newly built conveyor belts will now automatically try to copy the frequency
      and ID tag of any other conveyor belts immediately next to them. This lets you
      easily create long conveyor belt lines without having to configure every single
      one of them, so long as you configured the first one before building the others.
  - rscadd: 'Multitool buffer cloning now works on conveyor belts: Add a conveyor
      belt/conveyor switch to a Multitool''s buffer, click the Multitool in your hand
      to enable cloning mode, then click on a conveyor belt. It will instantly copy
      the frequency and ID tag from buffer, and if the buffer was taken from a conveyor
      belt, it will also copy it''s direction.'

      of the admin executing the statement, src is the object that is currently affected

      before. It still doesn't stun them, it's just to show the turrets are working.
  - bugfix: You now correctly get acid from nettles grinded in mortars.
  Shadowmech88:

      well as the general area.
  Intigracy:

      has been darkened, a reddish-brown, and gray) in their preferences. Gray is

      do not breathe, have no blood, are immune to burn damage, are unaffected by
      temperature extremes, and are immune to low pressure. They also cannot fire
      guns, cannot wear gloves, shoes, masks or exosuits, can only wear jumpsuits
      that fit obese people, and the breaking of a golem's limb results in complete
      detachment of it.

      other mob will recieve 4 notifications over time after the mob as died as to
      the status of the mob being digested, with the 4th finishing them off.
  - tweak: Grabbing someone to the point that it says '(now hands)' no longer causes
      them to drop what they're holding every second or so. This was done so that
      mobs who are grabbed while holding something can once again chestburst out of
      the thing that ate them.

      it to pretty much instantly gib.

      merchant, traveler). Traders spawn on the vox outpost. They are not on the crew
      manifest and they don''t have IDs, PDAs or any money.'
  - rscadd: Added a shuttle wreckage to Metaclub's asteroid. Because Metaclub's vox

      body temperature when at cool temperature

      brain is still inside the head. If using it on the body, the head needs to be
      5 tiles or less away from it.

  - rscadd: Added some new particle effects that move toward a target. Currently appear
      when using a soulstone, and when using the Drain rune.

      of plastic
2016-04-26:
  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Fixed the Adminbus being destroyable by Corrosive Acid.
  - rscadd: Simple_Animals xenomorphs (the ones that aren't player controlled) now
      have a brand new AI! They will spread weeds, break lights near them, and queens
      will place nests and eggs. They will automatically drag monkeys and incapacitated
      humans into those nests. Incidentally this means that xenobio will be able to
      create real xenos if they manage to gold slime an alien queen into existence!
  - tweak: NPC xenos no longer instantly break walls, instead they cover them with
      hyper acid that destroys them over 5 to 10 seconds. Not a very impactful change,
      but looks nice.
  - imageadd: Mobs stuck onto xeno nests now visually appear partially inside nest.
  - rscadd: Xeno weeds now progressively die out over time when the weed nodes are
      destroyed.
  - tweak: Xeno eggs now check for nearby potential victims as soon as they become
      grown, rather than having to wait for a valid human to walk nearby. This way
      they can jump onto victims that had been stuck onto nests before they were fully
      grown.
  - rscadd: You can attack burst xeno egg to fully remove them now.
  - tweak: All hot weapons now deal full damage to xeno eggs, previously only lit
      welder did.
  - tweak: Plasma cutters are now hot (which means you can light up your cigarette
      with one)
  - tweak: Getting stuck onto a xeno nest will stop you from bleeding out (from external
      wounds), as well as keep you supplied on a bit of inaprovaline, leporazine,
      and dexaline, sensibly improving your chances of survival (as well as the chances
      for a successful facehugger rape).
  - tweak: Facehuggers will now target monkeys as well as humans by themselves.
  - tweak: monkeys now appear bellow bedsheets layer items when lying down.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Fireballs now move faster, so you're a bit less likely to run into it right
      after casting.

      Fixed selecting 'all' not actually working.

2016-04-27:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Masks that can't be flipped now simply won't have a 'Flip Mask' button,
      as opposed to having a 'Flip Mask' button that does nothing but takes up space
      anyways.
