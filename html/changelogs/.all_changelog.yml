  Kurfurst:
  - bugfix: Extinguishers once again properly calm the heart of a rabid slime
2016-01-19:
  xpcybic:
  - wip: The following changes apply to Taxistation.
  - tweak: Enlarged engineering just a little.
  - rscadd: Added a singularity telescreen outside engine room.
  - tweak: Adjusted engine room so that rad collectors are closer to singularity generator.
  - bugfix: fixed a floating fire extinguisher in engineering.
  - tweak: Removed the table between kitchen and botany so that chefs and botanists
      can get between departments.
  - rscadd: Added two trays to hydroponics.
  - tweak: Enlarged xenobio cells to 2x3.
  - tweak: Adjusted lights in several areas which were too dim.
2016-01-22:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed nested storage items (e.g. a box inside a backpack) closing their
      inventory when you move, even if you were holding the parent storage item.
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to use screwdrivers as ghetto surgery tools.
  - tweak: Added an error message when trying to use surgery to fix a bone fracture
      in a very damaged limb. This is to prevent the \"bone explodes immediately after
      being mended\" syndrome.
  - tweak: Will no longer place items on operating tables, which was really annoying
      because it would end up in accidentally dropping your surgery tools under the
      patient. If you really want to place an item on top of the operating table for
      some reason, you can throw it on top instead.
2016-01-23:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed trays not picking up items. Fixed trays not removing their items
      when dropped or thrown. Fixed trays picking up items bigger than w_class = 3.
      Also fixed trays picking up trays. Also fixed a tray-related gamebreaking exploit
      that allowed you to permanently delete the nukedisk. Also fixed a tray-related
      gamebreaking exploit that allowed you to put any item inside a backpack, including
      other backpacks, and load a backpack past it's maximum storage slots. These
      things were really broken, weren't they?
  xpcybic:
  - wip: The following changes apply to Metaclub.
  - rscdel: Removed the hot drinks machine from permabrig.
  - rscadd: Added a newscaster to tcomms control room, for easy AI access.

2016-01-24:
  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Cult objectives and stuff should work fine in Mixed mode now. Might require
      some live testing so please give feedback at github.com/d3athrow/vgstation13/pull/7813
      if you end up in a Mixed cult round.
  - bugfix: Fixed new blood splatters not properly replicating the DNA of other blood
      splatters on their same turfs unless the round is cult.

  DrCelt:
  - experiment: SUMMARY
  - rscadd: Heat transfer Rehaul
  - rscadd: Hypothermia added
  - rscadd: changes to things that cause cold damage
  - rscadd: space blankets
  - rscadd: ghetto space suits with space blankets
  - rscadd: thermal homeostasis regulator that when emagged becomes the mancrowave
  - tweak: changes to cryo
  - experiment: INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HEAT TRANSFER
  - tweak: removes useless variables heat_protection & cold_protection as these were
      in 99% of circumstances the exact same as body_parts_covered
  - rscadd: added a new variable, heat_conductivity to all items, determining how
      fast they conduct heat away from you
  - rscadd: added new procs to humans, sweat() & burn_calories() - Now whenever you
      use up nutriment, you generate heat, but can also expend nutriment to decrease
      heat.
  - rscadd: refactored how heat transfer away from humans worked ( see above)
  - experiment: INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HYPOTHERMIA
  - rscadd: added Mild Hypothermia (between 32 and 35C) - this results in shivering,
      minor slowdown and messages informing the player that they are cold.
  - rscadd: added Moderate hypothermia (between 28 and 32C) - Shivering stops, slowdown
      increases, may slur/stutter words, chance of dropping items in hand and collapsing
      temporarily, as well as a 25% chance of forgetting how to use machines like
      when braindamaged
  - rscadd: added severe hypothermia (24 to 28C), shivering stops, player is unconcious,
      pulse decreases to 30BPM and has a 25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, which
      decreases over time as you are still breathing.
  - rscadd: added profound hypothermia (less than 24C), pulse stops, player has a
      25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, does not decrease over time as they are
      not breathing.
  - tweak: CHANGES THINGS WHICH CAUSE COLD DAMAGE, including but not limited to coldingtons,
      cryokinesis, showers, goliaths, temperature gun, and chemicals which chill people.
      Foam fire extinguishers are not affected.
  - experiment: THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR
  - experiment: Please use this when taking someone out of cryo
  - tweak: When a person is dragged in, it will automatically begin stabilising, there
      is no need for more buttons to be pressed
  - tweak: Takes 5 seconds to heat/cool someone to 37C, which works out as quicker
      than shaking someone up.
  - rscadd: Can be emagged to allow for three extra settings - this process is extremely
      visible, and there is a different sprite for when an emagged function is used
  - rscadd: Can reenable security features to quickly unemag the device and Can bring
      the device to an emergency stop.
  - experiment: CHANGES TO CRYO
  - tweak: Cryo now releases someone at 23C instead of -12C (or 25C if they manually
      eject)
  - experiment: PLEASE USE THE THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR AFTER TAKING PEOPLE OUT
      OF CRYO
  - tweak: Manual eject time brought down from 2 minutes to 30 seconds to make it
      time-neutral
  - tweak: This means that, as the person is ejected below profound hypothermia, they
      will not breathe until they heat up a wee bit further. This is a positive change,
      as vox & plasmamen will no longer die from toxin damage/fire immediately after
      leaving cryo.
  - rscadd: People inside a cryo cell do not suffer from hypothermia until leaving.
2016-01-26:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: Admins can now specify which modes they want in Mixed (among the modes
      allowed in Mixed)
  - imageadd: Revamped fireplaces.
  - imageadd: Paper bins have a new default sprite. Their sprite is now different
      whether there's a blank paper, a written paper, or a cult talisman on top.
  - rscadd: You can now also read the top paper or identify which talisman (if you're
      a cultist) is on top simply by examining the paper bin.
  Zth:
  - bugfix: Fixed flatpacks dissapearing when unstacking them.
2016-01-28:

      and it were to be destroyed in some manner
2016-02-02:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Better solution to the 'bone explodes immediately after being mended' syndrome.
      You will now once again be able to fix bones no matter the damage level of the
      limb. If the limb is so damaged that it would immediately break again after
      setting the bone, it will now heal to just under bone fracture levels. Note
      that this effectively lets you heal brute damage on dead people.
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: Added a bunch of wiki links for every antag roles in the Character Setup
      window. Also separated actual antag roles from non-antag special roles.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Sol Common is now Galactic Common.
  - rscadd: Added a new human-unique language, Sol Common. (Doesn't actually look
      a thing like Esperanto but that's what it's based off of)
  xpcybic:
  - wip: The following changes apply to Taxistation.
  - tweak: Cameras at each taxi dock will now appear first in the security and AI
      camera list.
  - bugfix: Fixed access on bar maintenance.
  - bugfix: Fixed floating, broken APC in solars near cargo.
  - bugfix: Fixed emergency shuttle brig not counting against the "escape alive and
      free" objective.

2016-02-03:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to point at things, use some alt-click interactions,
      strip people, toggle your mask, and maybe use a few other verbs while on a vehicle
      or buckled to a chair.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Sol Common is now blue, and uses its old syllables (Mandarin+English)

  Unid:
  - bugfix: Hypnotise costs 10 blood (instead of 0), bat form costs 30 blood (instead
      of 0), chiroptean screech costs 30 blood (instead of 10), shadowstep costs 20
      blood (instead of 0)
2016-02-04:
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: Merged flags_inv and body_parts_covered
  - bugfix: Fixed clothing being contaminated undesirably
  - bugfix: Fixes a bunch of unreported bugs due to the nature of the PR varying from
      the HoP jacket the riot suit and the stallhelm. If there is a bug where a sprite
      was overriding where it should not have this SHOULD fix that
  - experimental: This SHOULD also prevent that type of bug ever happening again.
      Please bugreport if you notice any sprite errors
  - rscadd: Adds is_slot_hidden proc
  - tweak: Splits head thermal conductivity into three parts
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where agent gas masks would conceal identities when their
      mask should not have.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where bloody hands were always visible on examine
  - tweak: You now lose heat to an environment if you have an exposed limb, no matter
      how wrapped up the other limbs are.
2016-02-05:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: When making bottles at a Chemmaster, you will now be prompted to input
      how many bottles you want to make before being prompted to name the bottles.
      This is to keep consistency with making pills (prevent bottles named '3'), and
      also allows the bottles to be automatically named after many units of chemicals
      they contain.
  - rscadd: You can now alt-click Chemmasters and All-in-One Grinders to eject their
      beaker, if they have one loaded.
2016-02-08:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed Diona nymphs talking in monkey language, rather than in rootspeak.
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: Adds a noir genetics block which the detective starts roundstart with
      if he has selected the "Gumshoe" alternate title. This block turns the client
      black and white except for blood.
  NigglyWiggly:
  - rscadd: Adds pajama hats, which you can now find in the PJ closet
  - rscadd: Adds greaser outfits from the suit dispenser.
  - imageadd: Adds casual hoodie and jeans or casual hoodie and skirt.
  - imageadd: Adds a keyhole sweater
  - imageadd: Adds winter casualwear and spring casualwear to the wintercrate and
      mixet closet respectively
  Sood:
  - bugfix: Facehuggers will no longer fight eachother over a person's face.
  - tweak: Facehuggers will no longer impregnate hosts that are already impregnated.
  - tweak: Facehuggers now have a health var. Currently this is only affected by bullets.
      They will die in most of the ways they died before.
  - rscadd: Facehuggers will now acquire targets and walk to them, and hug them when
      they're close enough.
2016-02-09:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Slightly buffed the surgery speed bonuses of advanced surgery tools (laser
      scalpels, surgical incision manager).
  - tweak: Fix-o-Vein, bone gel, and bone setters now have the same size as other
      surgery tools, meaning they now fit in pockets and boxes.
  - tweak: Circular saws and surgical drills no longer fit in pockets or boxes.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Masks do not protect against facehuggers. Wear a face-covering helmet such
      as a RIG helmet or bio hood.
  - experiment: Helmets have a 50% chance to be removed on facehugger attacks. This
      is a temporary balance change, but may stay if it this turns out to be enough.
  - bugfix: Facehugger toys will not forcefully remove headgear or path on their own.
      They will still leap at you if you walk next to them though.
  - bugfix: Sterile/non-real facehuggers will not protect against virile or real facehuggers.
2016-02-10:
  Pomf123:
  - bugfix: Fixed russian revolvers acting stupid.
  - bugfix: Fixed right clicking a job pref not decrementing the priority.
  Zth:
  - soundadd: Six sounds added.
  - rscadd: Resisting fires now makes you roll on the floor.
2016-02-12:
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: Had to hand in my Pull Request to the Chief - He'd always had it out for
      me, and the code ain't ever been in my favour, not since the war anyway. I looked
      it all over once more, tryin' to get to the bottom of this mystery, but it ain't
      easy finding bugs in some downtrodden code like this.I thought of that paddy
      dame that showed up in my office last week, asking for me to help her. Said
      someone called 'Gene Ettics' went AWOL. I told her I'd do what I could, and
      that's why I'm here. I opened up my flask of brandy and took a sip. It was going
      to be a long night. Chief or no chief, I'm getting to the bottom of this case.
  - rscadd: Re-adds the Noir Block.
  Pomf123:
  - bugfix: Fixed sechuds seeing through masks.
  TheEliminator16:
  - rscadd: Added the "Hostile Infestation" event. Similar to the normal infestation
      event, though this time with hostile mobs
  - rscadd: Added "Silent Meteors" event. Adminbus only, not random, allows for admins
      to send meteors without a command report. I'm sure this will never be abused,
      ever.
  - rscadd: Added "Organic Debris Field" event. Similar to meteors except instead
      of killing everyone, it splatters the outside of the station with gore, body
      parts, organs, exploding corpses...
  - rscadd: Added "Mass Drunkenness" event. Causes everyone on the station to be drunk
      for less than a minute.
  - rscadd: Added "Mass Hallucination", "Silent Meteors", "Hostile Infestation", "Organic
      Debris Field", and "Mass Drunkenness" events to admin secrets panel. Any admin
      with +FUN can access them.
  - rscadd: Made "Hostile Infestation", "Organic Debris Field", and "Mass Drunkenness"
      events possible to occur randomly.
  - rscadd: Added necromorphs.
  - rscadd: Added "spider queen", a large version of the nurse spider with a projectile
      attack that creates web where it lands and a lot of health.
2016-02-13:
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: Adds a space-worthy exploration suit only for greys. Sprites courtesy
      of Niggly.
  - rscadd: Adds vox, plasmaman, and grey spacesuit crates to cargo, so plasmamen
      hit by polyacid can finally get a replacement helmet and such.
  xpcybic:
  - wip: The following changes apply to Taxistation.
  - tweak: Redesigned almost all of medbay with the goal of reducing cramp and improving
      workflow between departments. Adds a lobby, moves sleepers/cryo to center, moves
      paramedic to left, moves patient rooms to upper-left, adds a medical storage
      room, enlarges genetics, virology, and CMO.
  - tweak: Changed morgue airlock to require either morgue or paramedic access.
  - tweak: Expanded the small room in medsci maint into an unfinished office.
  - bugfix: Fixed vent and scrubber piping in CE office.

  - bugfix: Fixed an incorrect airlock on the emergency shuttle.
  - rscadd: Fixed a severe lack of supplies on the syndicate shuttle.
  - bugfix: Fixed a docking port being too close to engi/cargo, preventing the syndicate
      shuttle from docking at it.
  - tweak: Adjusted derelict arrivals so that the salvage shuttle can dock at it.
2016-02-14:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed a very bizzare bug that could result in humans (especially lings,
      monkeymen, and head transplanted players) having TWO different blood types,
      each one of them only used for certain things.
  - bugfix: Monkeymen will now properly have randomized blood types.
  - rscdel: Players will now have randomized blood types as well. Random blood types
      follow a weighted distribution. Hopefully this will save Medbay from a lot of
      headaches.
  - experiment: 'The blood type distribution is as follows: 36% O+, 28% A+, 20% B+,
      5% AB+, 4% O-, 3% A-, 1% B-, 1% AB-. This is the same distribution Monkeymen
      were supposed to have, although a bug prevented it from working properly.'
  - rscadd: Your blood type is now added to your character notes when you spawn, in
      case you lose your ID (use the 'notes' verb, IC tab). You can check on other
      people's blood type by examining their ID or using the Medical Records database.
  - rscadd: Added a 'Wake-Up Cycle' option to Sleepers, which will try to wake up
      the occupant. This is intended to work as an alternative to the Mancrowave.
      Alt-clicking a Sleeper while an occupant is inside will automatically start
      this cycle.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Paralysis Summary timer not working properly on Sleepers (this
      will give you an approximation of how long the occupant's paralysis/sleep would
      last if left alone).
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Added the blunderbuss.
  - rscadd: Added the tomahawk.
  - rscadd: Added the pipe tomahawk.
  - rscadd: Added the cannon.
  - rscadd: Added the railgun.
  - rscadd: Added the sword.
  - rscadd: Added the executioner's sword.
  - rscadd: Added the venom sword.
  - rscadd: Added the Hivehand.
  - rscadd: Added the revialver.
  - rscadd: Added the blast cannon.
  - rscadd: Added the subspace tunneler.
  - soundadd: Added a cylinder spin sound for the russian revolver.
  - tweak: The chance of a limb being severed by a sharp weapon now scales with the
      weapon's sharpness.
  - rscadd: Added Anchor Arms.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Wizards now spawn with all organic limbs and internal organs.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added a new, disorienting hallucination effect.
2016-02-15:
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Baby carps now attack unconscious mobs. When they attack living mobs enough
      times, they grow up.
  - rscadd: Baby carps can be fed by attacking them with meat. Feeding them has a
      slight chance of making them your friend, and will eventually cause them to
      grow up.
  - rscadd: Baby animals now consider their mother's friends their friends. This applies
      to space carps, too
2016-02-16:
  JoeMother0:
  - imageadd: The Gumshoe detective alt title now starts with his own original suit
      and coat
2016-02-17:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Cryo cells now pop you out at a safe temperature once again, though just
      cold enough to give you the jitters for a few seconds. However, it takes 4 seconds
      to eject somebody from a Cryo cell. Essentially, the Mancrowave's body heat
      regulation functionality was directly implemented into Cryo.
  - rscadd: Cryo cells now also give a short period of grace to non-oxygen-breathing
      races after being ejected from Cryo, in which they won't breathe (and Plasmamen
      won't combust) so that they may be given internals safely. This is to replace
      the effects of post-cryo Hypothermia, which made people not breathe.
2016-02-19:
  CptWad:
  - rscadd: PBJ's code that makes it so now supermatters not on your z-level exploding
      will have no effect on your z-level.

      place.
  - bugfix: Repaired the pipes at cryo.
  - bugfix: The lightswitch in atmospherics is now reachable.
  - tweak: Moved the Phalanximine out of the CMO's office. You can still find it however.
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: The following changes are to Defficiency
  - rscadd: Ported over metaclubs Centcomm, so ERT and Deathsquad can exist and more
      room for bus
  - rscadd: Added the Vox Skipjack from box, so now Vox Raiders can happen on Defficiency
  - rscadd: Added the salvage shuttle to Z level 6, but as Defficiency is defficient
      of an aux-docking port, it cant dock to the station properly.
  - rscadd: Fixed a piping error in xenobiology, gave it and the research corridor
      some more vents considering the size
  - rscadd: Expanded the xenobotany area on the research outpost. It now also has
      gas-controlled trays (just need to wrench them down)
  - rscadd: Added an autolathe to R&D
  - rscadd: Fixed a few area mishaps (Area in front of the HoPs office that had no
      defined area, areas in the SME room that werent correct)
  - rscadd: Relocated the Mancrowave in medical to somewhere a bit more sensible,
      removed the Sec outpost from medical as it was unused.
  - rscadd: Removed stools from the brig as they no longer counted as chairs, but
      weapons.
  - rscadd: Added a vox outpost to the asteroid z-level, a bit off the beaten track
  SonixApache:
  - imageadd: Ian now wears his engineering RIG properly. He can also wear security

  Sood:
  - experiment: 'Deus Ex Update:'
  - tweak: (Deus Ex Update hijacked by Sood from N3X15)
  - rscadd: Lungs are now fully modular and actually process gas for humans.  Lungs
      must be compatible with a species or they will die of suffocation.
  - rscadd: Vox and Plasmamen have their own lungs.
  - rscadd: Most species currently exhale CO<sub>2</sub>.  Vox may be tweaked later

      compatible with all species and filter out some gasses (N2O and plasma), up
      to certain partial pressures.

      of reagents. Nothing yet makes any use of this, so all livers are standard UNTIL
      YOU CODE IT.
  - rscadd: Livers which are bruised will deal toxin damage to their owner if the
      user has any toxic reagents in their system. Ethanol with a bruised liver is
      extremely dangerous.

      Doctors beware.
  - rscadd: Eyes are modular and Advanced Type 1 eyes can grant enhanced nightvision

      electropack''s frequency and code.'

  - tweak: Kicking a lying human turns the attack into a stomp, dealing double damage.
  - tweak: Kicking a small item sends it flying.

      somebody while wearing magboots deals a lot of damage.
  - tweak: Talons increase kick damage if not wearing shoes. Vox now have talons.
  - rscadd: Vampires have to enable the Bite special attack to drain blood. Vampires

  - rscadd: You can now alt-click an IV drip to toggle mode. You can also clickdrag
      unlocked Cloning Pod into the floor to eject it.

      blueprints.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Holy water and bibles can now be used to de-thrall vamp thralls.
  - tweak: Holy water deconversion occurs in on_mob_life, so splashing them with it
      might not be as effective as injecting/ingesting.

  - tweak: The damage spears deal is now affected by the sharpness of the shard used
      to create it
  - tweak: Creation of a spear now takes some time, and can be interrupted

      (now damage is either randomly increased or decreased)

  - rscadd: You cannot do the following while the link is broken Call the shuttle,
      Recall the shuttle, Fax Central command, Send messages to Central Command, Call
      or Send the Cargo Shuttle
  - rscadd: Recieving normal messages from central command when the link is broken
      will appear gibberish and have a static sound.
  - rscadd: An admin may send an ungibberish message to the crew even when the link
      is broken, but he will be prompted first asking if he is sure.
  - rscadd: Blob alerts ignore whether or not the link with central command is broken
  PJB3005:

  - rscdel: Most vox and plasmaman helmets no longer protect from flashes.
2016-03-09:
  Icantthinkofanameritenow:
  - rscadd: Death Sting now injects cyanide instead of lexorin. Death Sting, DNA Extract
      Sting, and Horror Form all have reduced genome costs.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added morningstars and steel spears. They can be found in xenoarch.
  - rscadd: Added wooden bucklers. They can be crafted with planks, they're much less
      effective than normal shields and they can break after receiving enough damage.
2016-03-11:
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: Paint cans now require you to be standing next to the tile you're trying
      to paint, and take obstacles such as windows into account. RIP lubing through
      walls using XRAY.
2016-03-13:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: All Chemdispensers in Boxstation and Metastation now start with 100 energy,
      like they were intended to.

      on for it to check for anything, and it would always check for weapons with
      ID checking on.
  - bugfix: Weapon Permits (the access available from the HoP) now properly function.
      The abovenamed will no longer consider you a threat for having weapons if you
      have the access.

2016-03-14:
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Randomly selected structures will now generate somewhere on the map on
      the beginning of each round. Currently there are only 5 structures that can
      be generated, but it's very easy to make more!
2016-03-16:
  9600bauds:
  - tgs: Ported automatic material stacking from TG, full credits to MrPerson. This
      means that some stackable items (such as floortiles, cable coils, metal sheets
      etc) will now try to stack with eachother when they're in the same tile. This
      allows you to, for example, drag a floortile behind yourself to scoop up all
      the loose tiles in a hallway.
  - tweak: Silicate formula now results in 9 units instead of 3.
  Duny:
  - tweak: 'Deff: Re-added the security checkpoint in medbay.'
  - rscadd: 'Deff: Added a few additional air alarms in hallways.'

      plastic flaps would allow anyone to enter.'
  - rscadd: 'Deff: Added a bar of soap in both custodial closets.'
  Intigracy:
  - rscadd: It is now more obvious that you have to emag bots (think floorbots, beepsky,
      ed-209's, cleanbots, every bot ever) twice to get them to behave naughty.
  - experiment: Did you know you have to emag bots twice to make them actually get
      emagged? The first time only unlocks the controls for everyone to use.
  - imageadd: The bunsen burner now has a better sprite.
  - bugfix: Voicechangers can now properly choose the clown mask option to morph into.
  - tweak: 'Pushing someone pulling an occupied rollerbed is now treated like pushing
      someone pulling a prisoner: you can''t.'
  - rscadd: You can now make Universal Enzyme in chemistry using 1 unit each of Blood,
      Nutriment, and Sodium Chloride (salt)

      and universal enzyme.
  - imageadd: Vines ready to bear fruit have an icon now, instead of the standard
      heavy vine icon.
  - rscadd: You can now burn newspapers, just like you can with papers. Most of the
      properties of paper now apply to newspaper, such as recycling for wood, except
      newspapers deal a miniscule amount of damage when you hit things with them (ever
      been hit by a rolled up newspaper? It hurts.)
  - tweak: Goliaths are more obviously dead when dead.
  - rscadd: In order to break their vow, mimes now have a spell again instead of having

  - rscadd: The RobCo vending machine on the derelict now has atmos analyzers.
  - rscdel: Spacepods now no longer have their own verb tab when you get in. The one
      verb that's added is in the object tab.
  - tweak: Spacepods now only have one verb to enter/exit instead of two seperate
      ones. It's still in both the object tab and right click menu.
  - experiment: You have to wave your hands around to use the Force.
  - rscadd: You can now use TK even with broken hands and won't drop the items. You
      do need hands to use TK though, see above.
  TheEliminator16:
  - tweak: Changed instant death limit of medical nanobots to 20u. 5-20u is a danger
      zone that CAN result in horrors, the likelihood of which increases the more
      damage has been healed while nanobots have been above 5 units.
  - rscadd: Added different species of cyber horror for each playable race (except
      diona, because nanobots have no effect on dionae)
  - tweak: Made cryoxadone turn medical nanobots back into normal ones. This is both
      to discourage use in cryo mixes and act as a way to counteract nanobot overdoses.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added tournament lances - very long spears that are too heavy to use in
      normal combat. When traveling at fast speeds, tournament lances can be couched
      to deliver a devastating blow to anybody standing in your way (damage depends
      on distance traveled).
  - tweak: Tournament lances can be found on the asteroid as xenoarch finds.

      charged.

      between.

  - rscadd: 'Reworked conveyor belt construction to be faster and simpler: Conveyor
      belts are now built with their own machine frame which doesn''t require wiring
      and can be walked over. This new conveyor belt frame will also copy the direction
      you''re facing when building it. To make a conveyor belt assembly: Build it
      from 5 metal sheets, just like a machine frame.'
  - imgadd: Conveyor belt assembly sprites courtesy of Blithering.
  - rscadd: Newly built conveyor belts will now automatically try to copy the frequency
      and ID tag of any other conveyor belts immediately next to them. This lets you
      easily create long conveyor belt lines without having to configure every single
      one of them, so long as you configured the first one before building the others.
  - rscadd: 'Multitool buffer cloning now works on conveyor belts: Add a conveyor
      belt/conveyor switch to a Multitool''s buffer, click the Multitool in your hand
      to enable cloning mode, then click on a conveyor belt. It will instantly copy
      the frequency and ID tag from buffer, and if the buffer was taken from a conveyor
      belt, it will also copy it''s direction.'

      with it being 'a voice'.
  - rscadd: When the chaplain chooses a religion/deity it's now announced to everyone,
      this way you know who the one true god to pray to is.
  PJB3005:

  Shadowmech88:

      the cloner with less damage, too.

      https://github.com/d3athrow/vgstation13/pull/9222

      by grinding the chocolate bar or by Adminbus.
  - rscadd: Added a new chocolate bar called the "Old Empire Bar" as a reference to
      AoE. Contains a reagent called "rogan". Obtainable through hacking a Getmore

  - bugfix: SPS will now work correctly while inside a backpack or container.
  - tweak: SPS will no longer magically detect the name of their wearer (and will
      no longer report their wearer as 'unknown' if their face melts off), instead
      now broadcast their GPS tag. They also now broadcast precise coordinates as
      well as the general area.
  Intigracy:
  - rscadd: Plasmamen are now slightly less annoying when using the letter 's'. 's'
      becomes 's-s' and 'ss' becomes 'ss-ss' every time, no more long 's-s-s-s-s'
      messages.
  - rscadd: Vox names can now have the syllable 'yi' when randomly generated.

      and wrenching down a wood chair now correctly gives you 3 sheets of wood.
  - rscdel: Removes the message that everyone sees when the chaplain joins (which
      I added). Sounded good on paper, not so well in execution.
2016-04-14:
  Intigracy:
  - imageadd: Vox are now able to choose from 3 colors of skin (the current green
      has been darkened, a reddish-brown, and gray) in their preferences. Gray is
      the obvious best choice.
  - tweak: Vox raiders and adminspawned vox now get a random skin color. Admins are

      and italicized for over 20, Color and bold for over 40 damage.
  Shadowmech88:
  - tweak: Adamantine golems are now a proper race instead of humans in suits. They
      do not breathe, have no blood, are immune to burn damage, are unaffected by
      temperature extremes, and are immune to low pressure. They also cannot fire
      guns, cannot wear gloves, shoes, masks or exosuits, can only wear jumpsuits
      that fit obese people, and the breaking of a golem's limb results in complete
      detachment of it.

  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: 'Security helmets have gotten an upgrade to tactical helmets: They can
      now be attached with flashlights! This also includes the Warden''s hat, HoS''
      hat, and SWAT helmets.'

      on the ground.

  - tweak: Mobs eaten by other mobs are digested (unchanged). The person who ate the
      other mob will recieve 4 notifications over time after the mob as died as to
      the status of the mob being digested, with the 4th finishing them off.
  - tweak: Grabbing someone to the point that it says '(now hands)' no longer causes
      them to drop what they're holding every second or so. This was done so that
      mobs who are grabbed while holding something can once again chestburst out of
      the thing that ate them.
  - bugfix: Holding an arrow key while inside of a mob's stomach no longer causes
      it to pretty much instantly gib.
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: Changed it so that the medkit used in creation of a medbot makes it better
      at treating that form of damage (regular uses bicaridine, toxin uses anti-toxin,

  Unid:
  - rscadd: 'Added a new, vox-exclusive rounstart-only job: trader (alt titles: vagabond,
      merchant, traveler). Traders spawn on the vox outpost. They are not on the crew
      manifest and they don''t have IDs, PDAs or any money.'
  - rscadd: Added a shuttle wreckage to Metaclub's asteroid. Because Metaclub's vox
      outpost is overrun by aliens, traders spawn in the wreckage. Vox outposts on
      other maps have also received some basic supplies and tools.
2016-04-17:
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Your HUD no longer becomes black and white when you have noir vision.
  Unid:

      settings.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - experiment: Showers now heat a lot less, cool to 0C instead of -10C, and stabilize
      body temperature when at cool temperature
  - experiment: Showers will now have a 75 % chance of cleaning each individual part
      each tick, forcing people to shower for a bit instead of magically cleaning
      in one tick
  Intigracy:
  - imageadd: Binary now has a nice color to it.
  - tweak: Assburgers now give 10u mindbreaker, not 10u spiritbreaker.
  PJB3005:

      pipe, cable, etc... layout of the station for your view.
  - rscadd: Optical material scanners (that thing unobtainable unless you ask the
      admins) are reworked to be an auto-updating holomap, on your eyes.
  - bugfix: Optical meson scanners no longer provide welding protection.
2016-04-21:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Added a 'dump contents' verb to most reagent containers that lets you
      empty the contents of the container onto the floor, just like splashing a beaker.
  - rscadd: Added a 'empty container into' verb to sinks, urinals, and toilets. This
      lets you empty the contents of a container without making a mess on the floor.
      You can also alt-click to use this verb quickly.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: You'll no longer get Traders as an assassinate target.

      a body that had its brain already removed pre-decapitation.

      brain is still inside the head. If using it on the body, the head needs to be
      5 tiles or less away from it.
  - soundadd: Using a soulstone now emits a scary wailing.
  - rscadd: Added some new particle effects that move toward a target. Currently appear
      when using a soulstone, and when using the Drain rune.
  - imageadd: Added in-hand sprites for soulstones that have a shade in them.
  - rscdel: Removed the imprint mechanic of soulstones. If you summon a shade from
      a soulstone, you can now use the soulstone on someone else. Soulstones are still
      consumed when creating constructs though.
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: Dionae succumbing to death will actually die now.
  Probe1:
  - rscadd: Ports glass tables from /tg/ with lots of new sprites thanks to Dragonbro.

      of plastic
2016-04-26:
  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Fixed the Adminbus being destroyable by Corrosive Acid.
  - rscadd: Simple_Animals xenomorphs (the ones that aren't player controlled) now
      have a brand new AI! They will spread weeds, break lights near them, and queens
      will place nests and eggs. They will automatically drag monkeys and incapacitated
      humans into those nests. Incidentally this means that xenobio will be able to
      create real xenos if they manage to gold slime an alien queen into existence!
  - tweak: NPC xenos no longer instantly break walls, instead they cover them with
      hyper acid that destroys them over 5 to 10 seconds. Not a very impactful change,
      but looks nice.
  - imageadd: Mobs stuck onto xeno nests now visually appear partially inside nest.
  - rscadd: Xeno weeds now progressively die out over time when the weed nodes are
      destroyed.
  - tweak: Xeno eggs now check for nearby potential victims as soon as they become
      grown, rather than having to wait for a valid human to walk nearby. This way
      they can jump onto victims that had been stuck onto nests before they were fully
      grown.
  - rscadd: You can attack burst xeno egg to fully remove them now.
  - tweak: All hot weapons now deal full damage to xeno eggs, previously only lit
      welder did.
  - tweak: Plasma cutters are now hot (which means you can light up your cigarette
      with one)
  - tweak: Getting stuck onto a xeno nest will stop you from bleeding out (from external
      wounds), as well as keep you supplied on a bit of inaprovaline, leporazine,
      and dexaline, sensibly improving your chances of survival (as well as the chances
      for a successful facehugger rape).
  - tweak: Facehuggers will now target monkeys as well as humans by themselves.
  - tweak: monkeys now appear bellow bedsheets layer items when lying down.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Fireballs now move faster, so you're a bit less likely to run into it right
      after casting.
  xpcybic:
  - bugfix: Fixed the check in/out computer prompting twice when filtering by category.
      Fixed selecting 'all' not actually working.
  - spellcheck: Corrected the radio frequencies on the DJ satellite and ace reporter
      intercom manuals
2016-04-27:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Masks that can't be flipped now simply won't have a 'Flip Mask' button,
      as opposed to having a 'Flip Mask' button that does nothing but takes up space
      anyways.
2016-04-29:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: Blobs now emit a cloud of purple smoke over whatever they are affecting.
      So now you get a clear visual feedback when someone gets attacked by them, or
      they destroy something (wall or item).
  - rscadd: Huge revamp of the blob's visuals. Blobs now support two kind of looks.
      classic ones (made from 32x32 dmi) and new ones (made from 64x64 dmi)
  - rscadd: The new looks feature added overlays, animations, such as connections
      between the blobs, or various feedback animations (normal blob transmitting
      a pulse, factory producing a mob, resource producing a point, etc)
  - rscadd: The new looks also features a damage overlay, letting you know approximately
      how much health the blob part has. In the classic look, only the normal blobs
      have a damaged sprite.
  - rscadd: When a new blob gets created (through game mode, random event, or admin
      spawning), the overmind player gets to choose the blob's looks.
  - rscadd: Admins can set the looks of every blobs in the world by the push of a
      new button under the Fun tab.
  - rscadd: Resource blobs now look darker if the overmind they were connected to
      has died. Other overminds can hover near it to take ownership of them and re-activate
      them.
  - tweak: Overminds are now immune to singularities, their pull, and Nar-Sie.
  - rscadd: When a blob gets pulsed, it will now hurt any mob standing on their tile.
      Telescience teleporting you right next to the core so you can destroy it without
      any danger is no longer a viable strategy, unless you have a really good armor,
      a really powerful gun, and even then it will require some testing.
  - bugfix: Blobs cannot destroy docking ports anymore.
  - bugfix: The Blob Overmind's HUD now properly indicates how much health his core
      has.
  - rscadd: Added a lot of messages to Blob Overminds that trigger under a variety
      of conditions. Such as blobs near their core dying, a special blob that they've
      placed having been destroyed, or their core getting damaged.
  - rscadd: If there are multiple Blob Overminds in the world, they get instantly
      notified by the death of one of them. They also get notified by the death of
      any blob core, whether it had an overmind or not.
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Adds the mahoguny and the siren as admin-spawnable guns.
  - rscadd: Adds buckshot shells, orderable from Cargo in the shotgun shells crate.
  - tweak: The shotgun shells crate now contains a box of each kind of shell instead
      of ten loose lethal shells.
  - tweak: The railgun and blunderbuss can now be worn in the belt slot.
  - tweak: Diona now properly take increased burn damage from electrical shocks, and
      golems now properly take decreased burn damage from electrical shocks.
  - rscadd: All metal foam reactions will now create metal foam floors if they are
      on a space tile. Metal foam floors are airtight, but flimsy.
  - tweak: Metal foam reactions made with aluminum will no longer create metal foam
      walls.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Surgically attached limbs no longer magically transform when you attach
      them to another species' body (this means you can create a human with vox head,
      tajaran arms and muton legs).
  - tweak: Slightly changed how species restricted clothing works in respect to the
      above change. Now it's possible to, for example, wear vox magboots as a human
      - but only if both of the human's feet are vox talons.
2016-04-30:
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: EMP grenades now properly delete themselves after they trigger.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Vox traders now spawn with some money and coins.
  - rscadd: When vox traders spawn, they have an option to start with a traveler's
      ID. The ID has no access, and is only used for identification. Lore-wise, a
      traveler's ID is required to legally travel in human-controlled territories.

  Cloroxygen:
  - rscadd: Added Stationary Assembler MMIs - SAMMIs
2016-05-02:

  - bugfix: Portable and wall-mounted flashers no longer flash through sunglasses.
2016-05-06:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: The color of cult runes now matches the species blood color of whoever
      wrote it.
  - tweak: Tweaked the way cult runes look and pulsate a bit.
  - tweak: NPC hostile mobs with ranged weapons will no longer fire if there's a friendly
      unity between them and their target. Hivebots, aliens, syndicate agents, russians,
      etc, should stop killing each others now.
  - tweak: Ghosts now appear above the blob layer.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds now get notified when a new overmind appears in a blob
      core.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds now have a "damage overlay" that updates as their core
      takes damage. Similar to the one humans have when they take damage (screen borders
      become dark/reddish).
  - rscadd: Most of the Blob Overmind notifications added in the last update now have
      a (JUMP) button, so for example you can immediately find which of your blob
      nodes just got destroyed.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds have a new verb called "Call Overminds", which sends a
      notification to all the other overminds, along with a button allowing them to
      jump to you.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds that spawn in a blob core created by an Overmind are now
      called Blob Cerebrate. So they can easily tell which one of them was the original
      one (and the only one who can place new cores)
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Flesh to stone now lasts for 2.5 minutes rather than 8.5 minutes.
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: Adds back-from-the-dead regeneration for simple mobs, and adds it to certain
      mobs. Said mobs will need to have their bodies destroyed in some way to keep
      them down.
2016-05-07:
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: You may now only turn gas masks into ghetto space helmets, not every kind
      of mask that covers your face.
  - bugfix: Flipping a gas mask that's in the process of being turned into a ghetto
      space helmet no longer changes the icon incorrectly.
  cumoverme:
  - tweak: Fixed Ministation giving you stealing objectives for items which weren't
      in the station.
2016-05-08:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: (BLOB HUD) Blob Overminds now have their own amazing custom HUD. Points
      gauge on the left, Health gauge on the right. The health gauge start flashing
      when it gets low.
  - rscadd: (BLOB HUD) Buttons that require more points than you currently have appear
      grayscale.
  - rscadd: (BLOB HUD) You can always jump back to your core using the small button
      to the top left. The first 24 special blobs that you've created (not counting
      the ones that got destroyed) also appear at the top, and you can quickly teleport
      from one to another by clicking them.
  - rscdel: Removed the obsolete and broken Blob random event.
  - rscadd: Added two new random events, Blob Cluster and Blob Conglomerate. The former
      is like a medium intensity meteor shower, sending a handful of blobs and node
      blobs at the station (about as rare as Communications Blackout). The later is
      a high intensity meteor storm, sending blobs, node blobs, and a few blob cores
      (I had 2-3 cores per showers during testing. This one is much rarer, one of
      the rarest events in fact, along with alien infestation and electrical storm).
      Both events can only trigger after 30 minutes have elapsed.
  - soundadd: Blobs now make sounds when they attack mobs.
  - experiment: Added a new meteor gun intended for testing and debugging that lets
      its user choose which type of meteor to fire.
  - bugfix: As confirmed by dylan, meteors aren't supposed to move from a Z Level
      to the next. So it's getting fixed at last.
  - soundadd: Added a few new server restart sound files.
  Unid:
  - tweak: Vomiting now removes some chemicals from your body.
  - rscadd: You can now vomit into a toilet by standing over it. It's also possible
      to vomit into a reagent container (like a bucket or a beaker) by either standing
      over it, or holding it while vomiting. Vomiting into a container partially fills
      it.
  - rscadd: Pools of vomit now dry over time. You can use a dropper or a syringe on
      a fresh pool of vomit to extract some of the substance.
2016-05-09:
  Intigracy:
  - rscadd: Adds miniature black holes. They function exactly like bags of holding
      except they fit in pockets. Currently admin spawn only for obvious balance reasons.
2016-05-14:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: 'Made conveyor construction even simpler: Upon being built, conveyor belts
      will now try to copy configuration from adjacent conveyor switches, as well
      as other belts. Conveyor switches now also start with a random ID tag, rather
      than null.'
  Deity Link:
  - tweak: Blob Conglomerates can now only happen if there are 25 or more living players
      on the station. Including at least a sec officer and an engineer.
  - rscadd: Bomberman Bombs now affect blobs.
  Probe1:
  - rscadd: New Tradeship for Vox Traders on Box.  Requires a Vox Trader ID to access
      and use.  Make sure you accept that ID at round start if you want an easy way
      to trade.  Arrivals and Vox Outpost have been slightly modified to accomodate
      it, as well as a few minor bug fixes along the way to the general areas.
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Added more clown names.
  Sood:
  - rscadd: Admins may now toggle wages for all personal and departmental accounts

      also via game panel.
  - tweak: Accounts database machine can now see what an account would earn per paycheck.
  - tweak: Power cables will no longer shock you unless you click on a cable end or
      are using tools on them.
  - tweak: This means that wirecutters on cables still might shock you but bruise
      packs will not.
  - tweak: UNLESS IT IS A CABLE END.
  Unid:
  - tweak: Refactored away missions.
  - rscadd: Admins can now spawn away missions during the round using a new button

  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Escape attempts from alien nests no longer carry over when you get trapped
      again on that same nest.
  - tweak: Aliens can no longer trap human players on nests if they are standing up.
      They need to at least tackle them first, or make them fall one way or another.
      Doesn't apply to braindeads.
