      blueprints.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Holy water and bibles can now be used to de-thrall vamp thralls.

  - rscadd: Added wooden bucklers. They can be crafted with planks, they're much less

  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: Paint cans now require you to be standing next to the tile you're trying

  - tweak: All Chemdispensers in Boxstation and Metastation now start with 100 energy,
      like they were intended to.

      a threat for holding floral somatories, hookshots, or defibs.

      on for it to check for anything, and it would always check for weapons with
      ID checking on.

      The abovenamed will no longer consider you a threat for having weapons if you
      have the access.

2016-03-14:
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Randomly selected structures will now generate somewhere on the map on
      the beginning of each round. Currently there are only 5 structures that can
      be generated, but it's very easy to make more!
2016-03-16:
  9600bauds:
  - tgs: Ported automatic material stacking from TG, full credits to MrPerson. This
      means that some stackable items (such as floortiles, cable coils, metal sheets
      etc) will now try to stack with eachother when they're in the same tile. This
      allows you to, for example, drag a floortile behind yourself to scoop up all
      the loose tiles in a hallway.

  Duny:

  - rscadd: 'Deff: Added a few additional air alarms in hallways.'

      and will fuck up if built vertically.'
  - rscadd: 'Deff: Added windoors behind plastic flaps in places where simply deconstructing
      plastic flaps would allow anyone to enter.'
  - rscadd: 'Deff: Added a bar of soap in both custodial closets.'
  Intigracy:
  - rscadd: It is now more obvious that you have to emag bots (think floorbots, beepsky,
      ed-209's, cleanbots, every bot ever) twice to get them to behave naughty.
  - experiment: Did you know you have to emag bots twice to make them actually get
      emagged? The first time only unlocks the controls for everyone to use.
  - imageadd: The bunsen burner now has a better sprite.
  - bugfix: Voicechangers can now properly choose the clown mask option to morph into.
  - tweak: 'Pushing someone pulling an occupied rollerbed is now treated like pushing
      someone pulling a prisoner: you can''t.'

      Nutriment, and Sodium Chloride (salt)

      and universal enzyme.
  - imageadd: Vines ready to bear fruit have an icon now, instead of the standard
      heavy vine icon.
  - rscadd: You can now burn newspapers, just like you can with papers. Most of the
      properties of paper now apply to newspaper, such as recycling for wood, except
      newspapers deal a miniscule amount of damage when you hit things with them (ever
      been hit by a rolled up newspaper? It hurts.)
  - tweak: Goliaths are more obviously dead when dead.
  - rscadd: In order to break their vow, mimes now have a spell again instead of having

  - rscadd: The RobCo vending machine on the derelict now has atmos analyzers.
  - rscdel: Spacepods now no longer have their own verb tab when you get in. The one
      verb that's added is in the object tab.
  - tweak: Spacepods now only have one verb to enter/exit instead of two seperate
      ones. It's still in both the object tab and right click menu.
  - experiment: You have to wave your hands around to use the Force.
  - rscadd: You can now use TK even with broken hands and won't drop the items. You
      do need hands to use TK though, see above.
  TheEliminator16:
  - tweak: Changed instant death limit of medical nanobots to 20u. 5-20u is a danger
      zone that CAN result in horrors, the likelihood of which increases the more
      damage has been healed while nanobots have been above 5 units.
  - rscadd: Added different species of cyber horror for each playable race (except
      diona, because nanobots have no effect on dionae)
  - tweak: Made cryoxadone turn medical nanobots back into normal ones. This is both
      to discourage use in cryo mixes and act as a way to counteract nanobot overdoses.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added tournament lances - very long spears that are too heavy to use in
      normal combat. When traveling at fast speeds, tournament lances can be couched
      to deliver a devastating blow to anybody standing in your way (damage depends
      on distance traveled).
  - tweak: Tournament lances can be found on the asteroid as xenoarch finds.

      belts are now built with their own machine frame which doesn''t require wiring
      and can be walked over. This new conveyor belt frame will also copy the direction
      you''re facing when building it. To make a conveyor belt assembly: Build it
      from 5 metal sheets, just like a machine frame.'
  - imgadd: Conveyor belt assembly sprites courtesy of Blithering.
  - rscadd: Newly built conveyor belts will now automatically try to copy the frequency
      and ID tag of any other conveyor belts immediately next to them. This lets you
      easily create long conveyor belt lines without having to configure every single
      one of them, so long as you configured the first one before building the others.
  - rscadd: 'Multitool buffer cloning now works on conveyor belts: Add a conveyor
      belt/conveyor switch to a Multitool''s buffer, click the Multitool in your hand
      to enable cloning mode, then click on a conveyor belt. It will instantly copy
      the frequency and ID tag from buffer, and if the buffer was taken from a conveyor
      belt, it will also copy it''s direction.'

      the chaplain, B) a deity name of their choosing, or C) the current behavior
      with it being 'a voice'.

      this way you know who the one true god to pray to is.

  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Surgeon switchtools now fit in pockets when not activated.

      fairy wings that currently make you naked.

      from you, some weren't.
  - tweak: Enthrall now costs 150 blood to use, up from free.

  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Fixed artificers creation message telling them that they can use Magic
      Missile
  - tweak: Improved constructs creation messages all around
  - tweak: Juggernaut beam reflects work just like ablative armors' now. (They still
      take half damage)
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: Wrenching down a comfy chair now correctly gives you 2 sheets of metal,
      and wrenching down a wood chair now correctly gives you 3 sheets of wood.
  - rscdel: Removes the message that everyone sees when the chaplain joins (which
      I added). Sounded good on paper, not so well in execution.
2016-04-14:
  Intigracy:
  - imageadd: Vox are now able to choose from 3 colors of skin (the current green
      has been darkened, a reddish-brown, and gray) in their preferences. Gray is
      the obvious best choice.
  - tweak: Vox raiders and adminspawned vox now get a random skin color. Admins are
      able to varedit vox skin colors by changing s_tone and regenerating icons.
  - bugfix: Fixes people going bald when they join before the game initializes.
  - tweak: You can't use the three buttons on the popup on joining the game until
      the game has initialized.
2016-04-15:
  9600bauds:
  - soundadd: Soda cans now start sealed and have an opening sound. For some reason.
  Probe1:
  - tweak: Chemmasters once again use 10 pills as the default input when making multiple
      pills.
  - tweak: Examine self now shows wounds in the color matching their damage type.  Color
      and italicized for over 20, Color and bold for over 40 damage.
  Shadowmech88:
  - tweak: Adamantine golems are now a proper race instead of humans in suits. They
      do not breathe, have no blood, are immune to burn damage, are unaffected by
      temperature extremes, and are immune to low pressure. They also cannot fire
      guns, cannot wear gloves, shoes, masks or exosuits, can only wear jumpsuits
      that fit obese people, and the breaking of a golem's limb results in complete
      detachment of it.
2016-04-16:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: 'Security helmets have gotten an upgrade to tactical helmets: They can
      now be attached with flashlights! This also includes the Warden''s hat, HoS''
      hat, and SWAT helmets.'
  - rscadd: To unattach the flashlight attachment from a helmet, use a screwdriver.

  - rscadd: An alien who dies via meat spike will have their stomachs emptied out
      on the ground.
  - rscadd: Mobs (such as aliens or fatass humans) can now only eat one mob at a time.
  - tweak: Mobs eaten by other mobs are digested (unchanged). The person who ate the
      other mob will recieve 4 notifications over time after the mob as died as to
      the status of the mob being digested, with the 4th finishing them off.
  - tweak: Grabbing someone to the point that it says '(now hands)' no longer causes
      them to drop what they're holding every second or so. This was done so that
      mobs who are grabbed while holding something can once again chestburst out of
      the thing that ate them.
  - bugfix: Holding an arrow key while inside of a mob's stomach no longer causes
      it to pretty much instantly gib.
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: Changed it so that the medkit used in creation of a medbot makes it better
      at treating that form of damage (regular uses bicaridine, toxin uses anti-toxin,
      fire uses kelotane, oxydep uses dexalin)
  Unid:
  - rscadd: 'Added a new, vox-exclusive rounstart-only job: trader (alt titles: vagabond,
      merchant, traveler). Traders spawn on the vox outpost. They are not on the crew
      manifest and they don''t have IDs, PDAs or any money.'
  - rscadd: Added a shuttle wreckage to Metaclub's asteroid. Because Metaclub's vox
      outpost is overrun by aliens, traders spawn in the wreckage. Vox outposts on
      other maps have also received some basic supplies and tools.
2016-04-17:
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Your HUD no longer becomes black and white when you have noir vision.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Vox traders are back! Now they also start with a station bounced radio

      wallet and some food provisions.
2016-04-18:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: You can now alt-click a jumpsuit (while worn or in your inventory) to
      bring up the suit sensors menu.
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a radio or headset (while worn or in your inventory) will
      now work the same as using it in your hand, bringing up the frequency/channel
      settings.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - experiment: Showers now heat a lot less, cool to 0C instead of -10C, and stabilize
      body temperature when at cool temperature
  - experiment: Showers will now have a 75 % chance of cleaning each individual part
      each tick, forcing people to shower for a bit instead of magically cleaning
      in one tick
  Intigracy:
  - imageadd: Binary now has a nice color to it.
  - tweak: Assburgers now give 10u mindbreaker, not 10u spiritbreaker.
  PJB3005:

      pipe, cable, etc... layout of the station for your view.
  - rscadd: Optical material scanners (that thing unobtainable unless you ask the
      admins) are reworked to be an auto-updating holomap, on your eyes.
  - bugfix: Optical meson scanners no longer provide welding protection.
2016-04-21:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Added a 'dump contents' verb to most reagent containers that lets you
      empty the contents of the container onto the floor, just like splashing a beaker.
  - rscadd: Added a 'empty container into' verb to sinks, urinals, and toilets. This
      lets you empty the contents of a container without making a mess on the floor.
      You can also alt-click to use this verb quickly.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: You'll no longer get Traders as an assassinate target.
  - tweak: Posibrains no longer talk like people.
  Unid:

      a body that had its brain already removed pre-decapitation.
  - rscadd: You can now use soulstone on decapitated bodies or heads, as long as the
      brain is still inside the head. If using it on the body, the head needs to be
      5 tiles or less away from it.
  - soundadd: Using a soulstone now emits a scary wailing.
  - rscadd: Added some new particle effects that move toward a target. Currently appear
      when using a soulstone, and when using the Drain rune.
  - imageadd: Added in-hand sprites for soulstones that have a shade in them.
  - rscdel: Removed the imprint mechanic of soulstones. If you summon a shade from
      a soulstone, you can now use the soulstone on someone else. Soulstones are still
      consumed when creating constructs though.
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: Dionae succumbing to death will actually die now.
  Probe1:
  - rscadd: Ports glass tables from /tg/ with lots of new sprites thanks to Dragonbro.
2016-04-25:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Plasmamen suits now have unlimited extinguishing charges, up from 10.
  Clusterfack:
  - rscadd: T3 part requirements go back to being gold, silver, and uranium instead
      of plastic
2016-04-26:
  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Fixed the Adminbus being destroyable by Corrosive Acid.
  - rscadd: Simple_Animals xenomorphs (the ones that aren't player controlled) now
      have a brand new AI! They will spread weeds, break lights near them, and queens
      will place nests and eggs. They will automatically drag monkeys and incapacitated
      humans into those nests. Incidentally this means that xenobio will be able to
      create real xenos if they manage to gold slime an alien queen into existence!
  - tweak: NPC xenos no longer instantly break walls, instead they cover them with
      hyper acid that destroys them over 5 to 10 seconds. Not a very impactful change,
      but looks nice.
  - imageadd: Mobs stuck onto xeno nests now visually appear partially inside nest.
  - rscadd: Xeno weeds now progressively die out over time when the weed nodes are
      destroyed.
  - tweak: Xeno eggs now check for nearby potential victims as soon as they become
      grown, rather than having to wait for a valid human to walk nearby. This way
      they can jump onto victims that had been stuck onto nests before they were fully
      grown.
  - rscadd: You can attack burst xeno egg to fully remove them now.
  - tweak: All hot weapons now deal full damage to xeno eggs, previously only lit
      welder did.
  - tweak: Plasma cutters are now hot (which means you can light up your cigarette
      with one)
  - tweak: Getting stuck onto a xeno nest will stop you from bleeding out (from external
      wounds), as well as keep you supplied on a bit of inaprovaline, leporazine,
      and dexaline, sensibly improving your chances of survival (as well as the chances
      for a successful facehugger rape).
  - tweak: Facehuggers will now target monkeys as well as humans by themselves.
  - tweak: monkeys now appear bellow bedsheets layer items when lying down.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Fireballs now move faster, so you're a bit less likely to run into it right
      after casting.
  xpcybic:
  - bugfix: Fixed the check in/out computer prompting twice when filtering by category.
      Fixed selecting 'all' not actually working.
  - spellcheck: Corrected the radio frequencies on the DJ satellite and ace reporter
      intercom manuals
2016-04-27:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Masks that can't be flipped now simply won't have a 'Flip Mask' button,
      as opposed to having a 'Flip Mask' button that does nothing but takes up space
      anyways.
2016-04-29:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: Blobs now emit a cloud of purple smoke over whatever they are affecting.
      So now you get a clear visual feedback when someone gets attacked by them, or
      they destroy something (wall or item).
  - rscadd: Huge revamp of the blob's visuals. Blobs now support two kind of looks.
      classic ones (made from 32x32 dmi) and new ones (made from 64x64 dmi)
  - rscadd: The new looks feature added overlays, animations, such as connections
      between the blobs, or various feedback animations (normal blob transmitting
      a pulse, factory producing a mob, resource producing a point, etc)
  - rscadd: The new looks also features a damage overlay, letting you know approximately
      how much health the blob part has. In the classic look, only the normal blobs
      have a damaged sprite.
  - rscadd: When a new blob gets created (through game mode, random event, or admin
      spawning), the overmind player gets to choose the blob's looks.
  - rscadd: Admins can set the looks of every blobs in the world by the push of a
      new button under the Fun tab.
  - rscadd: Resource blobs now look darker if the overmind they were connected to
      has died. Other overminds can hover near it to take ownership of them and re-activate
      them.
  - tweak: Overminds are now immune to singularities, their pull, and Nar-Sie.
  - rscadd: When a blob gets pulsed, it will now hurt any mob standing on their tile.
      Telescience teleporting you right next to the core so you can destroy it without
      any danger is no longer a viable strategy, unless you have a really good armor,
      a really powerful gun, and even then it will require some testing.
  - bugfix: Blobs cannot destroy docking ports anymore.
  - bugfix: The Blob Overmind's HUD now properly indicates how much health his core
      has.
  - rscadd: Added a lot of messages to Blob Overminds that trigger under a variety
      of conditions. Such as blobs near their core dying, a special blob that they've
      placed having been destroyed, or their core getting damaged.
  - rscadd: If there are multiple Blob Overminds in the world, they get instantly
      notified by the death of one of them. They also get notified by the death of
      any blob core, whether it had an overmind or not.
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Adds the mahoguny and the siren as admin-spawnable guns.
  - rscadd: Adds buckshot shells, orderable from Cargo in the shotgun shells crate.
  - tweak: The shotgun shells crate now contains a box of each kind of shell instead
      of ten loose lethal shells.
  - tweak: The railgun and blunderbuss can now be worn in the belt slot.
  - tweak: Diona now properly take increased burn damage from electrical shocks, and
      golems now properly take decreased burn damage from electrical shocks.
  - rscadd: All metal foam reactions will now create metal foam floors if they are
      on a space tile. Metal foam floors are airtight, but flimsy.
  - tweak: Metal foam reactions made with aluminum will no longer create metal foam
      walls.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Surgically attached limbs no longer magically transform when you attach
      them to another species' body (this means you can create a human with vox head,
      tajaran arms and muton legs).
  - tweak: Slightly changed how species restricted clothing works in respect to the
      above change. Now it's possible to, for example, wear vox magboots as a human
      - but only if both of the human's feet are vox talons.
2016-04-30:
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: EMP grenades now properly delete themselves after they trigger.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Vox traders now spawn with some money and coins.
  - rscadd: When vox traders spawn, they have an option to start with a traveler's
      ID. The ID has no access, and is only used for identification. Lore-wise, a
      traveler's ID is required to legally travel in human-controlled territories.

  Cloroxygen:
  - rscadd: Added Stationary Assembler MMIs - SAMMIs
2016-05-02:
  Zth:

  - bugfix: Portable and wall-mounted flashers no longer flash through sunglasses.
2016-05-06:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: The color of cult runes now matches the species blood color of whoever
      wrote it.
  - tweak: Tweaked the way cult runes look and pulsate a bit.
  - tweak: NPC hostile mobs with ranged weapons will no longer fire if there's a friendly
      unity between them and their target. Hivebots, aliens, syndicate agents, russians,
      etc, should stop killing each others now.
  - tweak: Ghosts now appear above the blob layer.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds now get notified when a new overmind appears in a blob
      core.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds now have a "damage overlay" that updates as their core
      takes damage. Similar to the one humans have when they take damage (screen borders
      become dark/reddish).
  - rscadd: Most of the Blob Overmind notifications added in the last update now have
      a (JUMP) button, so for example you can immediately find which of your blob
      nodes just got destroyed.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds have a new verb called "Call Overminds", which sends a
      notification to all the other overminds, along with a button allowing them to
      jump to you.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds that spawn in a blob core created by an Overmind are now
      called Blob Cerebrate. So they can easily tell which one of them was the original
      one (and the only one who can place new cores)
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Flesh to stone now lasts for 2.5 minutes rather than 8.5 minutes.
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: Adds back-from-the-dead regeneration for simple mobs, and adds it to certain
      mobs. Said mobs will need to have their bodies destroyed in some way to keep
      them down.
2016-05-07:
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: You may now only turn gas masks into ghetto space helmets, not every kind
      of mask that covers your face.
  - bugfix: Flipping a gas mask that's in the process of being turned into a ghetto
      space helmet no longer changes the icon incorrectly.
  cumoverme:
  - tweak: Fixed Ministation giving you stealing objectives for items which weren't
      in the station.
2016-05-08:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: (BLOB HUD) Blob Overminds now have their own amazing custom HUD. Points
      gauge on the left, Health gauge on the right. The health gauge start flashing
      when it gets low.
  - rscadd: (BLOB HUD) Buttons that require more points than you currently have appear
      grayscale.
  - rscadd: (BLOB HUD) You can always jump back to your core using the small button
      to the top left. The first 24 special blobs that you've created (not counting
      the ones that got destroyed) also appear at the top, and you can quickly teleport
      from one to another by clicking them.
  - rscdel: Removed the obsolete and broken Blob random event.
  - rscadd: Added two new random events, Blob Cluster and Blob Conglomerate. The former
      is like a medium intensity meteor shower, sending a handful of blobs and node
      blobs at the station (about as rare as Communications Blackout). The later is
      a high intensity meteor storm, sending blobs, node blobs, and a few blob cores
      (I had 2-3 cores per showers during testing. This one is much rarer, one of
      the rarest events in fact, along with alien infestation and electrical storm).
      Both events can only trigger after 30 minutes have elapsed.
  - soundadd: Blobs now make sounds when they attack mobs.
  - experiment: Added a new meteor gun intended for testing and debugging that lets
      its user choose which type of meteor to fire.
  - bugfix: As confirmed by dylan, meteors aren't supposed to move from a Z Level
      to the next. So it's getting fixed at last.
  - soundadd: Added a few new server restart sound files.
  Unid:
  - tweak: Vomiting now removes some chemicals from your body.
  - rscadd: You can now vomit into a toilet by standing over it. It's also possible
      to vomit into a reagent container (like a bucket or a beaker) by either standing
      over it, or holding it while vomiting. Vomiting into a container partially fills
      it.
  - rscadd: Pools of vomit now dry over time. You can use a dropper or a syringe on
      a fresh pool of vomit to extract some of the substance.
2016-05-09:
  Intigracy:
  - rscadd: Adds miniature black holes. They function exactly like bags of holding
      except they fit in pockets. Currently admin spawn only for obvious balance reasons.
2016-05-14:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: 'Made conveyor construction even simpler: Upon being built, conveyor belts
      will now try to copy configuration from adjacent conveyor switches, as well
      as other belts. Conveyor switches now also start with a random ID tag, rather
      than null.'
  Deity Link:
  - tweak: Blob Conglomerates can now only happen if there are 25 or more living players
      on the station. Including at least a sec officer and an engineer.
  - rscadd: Bomberman Bombs now affect blobs.
  Probe1:
  - rscadd: New Tradeship for Vox Traders on Box.  Requires a Vox Trader ID to access
      and use.  Make sure you accept that ID at round start if you want an easy way
      to trade.  Arrivals and Vox Outpost have been slightly modified to accomodate
      it, as well as a few minor bug fixes along the way to the general areas.
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Added more clown names.
  Sood:
  - rscadd: Admins may now toggle wages for all personal and departmental accounts
      in the game panel. This starts off disabled and must be added to config.txt

      also via game panel.
  - tweak: Accounts database machine can now see what an account would earn per paycheck.
  - tweak: Power cables will no longer shock you unless you click on a cable end or
      are using tools on them.
  - tweak: This means that wirecutters on cables still might shock you but bruise
      packs will not.
  - tweak: UNLESS IT IS A CABLE END.
  Unid:
  - tweak: Refactored away missions.
  - rscadd: Admins can now spawn away missions during the round using a new button

      again on that same nest.

      They need to at least tackle them first, or make them fall one way or another.
      Doesn't apply to braindeads.

      '?' or '!'.
  Kurfurst:

      for easy transport.
  Probe1:
  - tweak: PTech vends (HoP vending machines found on Metaclub and Mini) now stock
      all PDA cartridges and require HoP access to use.  Plus some minor formatting
      and code style changes to all vends that require access.

      any vault, away mission or external map file into the game. Warning: loading

      have single use spellbooks.

      stations etc.
  - bugfix: Also fixed Cyborgs and MoMMIs being able to weld/unweld a locker from

      that a silicon should be to do suddenly not working anymore, please don't hesitate
      to make a bug report.

      more accurate timestamps.
  - rscdel: 'Killed innocent kitten #394.'

  Shadowmech88:
  - bugfix: Fixed borer unlock prerequisites. Borers are now able to unlock dexalin

      hosts, as was always intended.
2016-06-10:
  Albinobigfoot:
  - tweak: You can now grab an item from your inventory by clicking on its storage
      slot, as if you had selected the item's pixel itself.
  - tweak: This works for items in storage (e.g. backpacks, boxes, bags, etc.), items
      on your person (e.g. pockets, suit storage, belt slot, etc.), as well as borg
      and mommi modules.
  - rscadd: Adds a prisoner Plasma Man suit and helmet. Complete sets can be found
      in regular prisoner dress lockers.
  Intigracy:
  - rscdel: Cuban pete no longer gives you a free bomb when you beat him via emagged
      arcade.
  - tweak: The maracas Pete gives you for beating him are now by default emagged,
      meaning when you throw them at something they explode.
  - tweak: Buffed the emagged maraca explosion. It will now cause a hull breach if
      thrown at a floor, and will gib dead bodies. It deals about 100 damage when
      thrown at mobs.
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Adds a new type of secure locker, the vault locker. Vault lockers are
      immovable, explosion-proof, EMP-proof, and have 100 times the health of a standard
      locker.

  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: 'Added targeted use for hailers: You can now click on people to hail at
      them, like you would click to shoot a gun or throw an item. Directly hailing
      at someone will give them a big red bold message telling them to halt, and will
      specifically call them out by name in chat with the line ''(You) hails for X
      to halt!''. This also has aim assist in the form of working in a 3x3 square
      around where you clicked, to make it easier to hail moving targets.'
  - imageadd: New Hailer warning sprites courtesy of Blithering.
  - rscadd: MoMMI material synthetizers can now scan wooden planks, plastic sheets,
      and carpet tiles. They still cannot scan anything else. Likewise, borg/human

  - rscadd: Added four new plants, specific to the Seed 'n' Feed. They are Breadfruit,
      Woodapple, Chicken of the Stars, and Garlic.

      they go together like chicken and gravy.

  - bugfix: Fixed an edge-case issue where people were mistakenly believing that N3X15
      made a changelog entry recently.

  cumoverme:
  - rscadd: 'Added six new hairs: Long Ponytail, High Ponytail, Side Ponytail 1, Side
      Ponytail 2, One Shoulder and Tress Shoulder. Let the waifu age begin!'
2016-06-15:
  DrCelt:
  - tweak: changes the effect of high pressure on heat loss.
  - tweak: disables high pressure heat loss multiplier effect on ventcrawling mobs.
  Exxion:
  - tweak: Bandoliers are now accessories rather than exosuits. This means they attach
      directly to your jumpsuit rather than taking up your exosuit slot. They can
      be removed with the Remove Accessory verb. You should be able to figure out
      how to use them. Note that, like other storage accessories, they must be removed
      in order to take the jumpsuit off by yourself.
  - bugfix: Fixes storage accessories not being visible on jumpsuits in the inventory.
  Faptastic:
  - rscadd: The miner borg module now has a destination tagger and package wrap.

      per drawing)
  Zealotron:
  - spellcheck: TYPOS have been FIXED.
2016-06-17:
  ArthurDentist:
  - rscadd: The cloning Console can now be emagged. Emagging the Cloning Console will
      allow you to edit the records of people who have been scanned allowing you to
      change their name or species.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - rscadd: Massively expanded the Vox Outpost for the benefit of the traders there
  - tweak: Changed the Courtroom significantly. You'll need to use the TV Monitors
      to watch the proceedings properly (won't be able to see judge from seats) but
      they broadcast speech and the seats, so it's functionally identical
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Borers can now inhabit a human's left arm, right arm, left leg, right
      leg, and chest in addition to their head. A human may have one borer in each
      of these limbs. The borer's available evolutions are influenced by the limb
      it is currently inhabiting.
2016-06-18:
  9600bauds:
  - experiment: The following changes required a lot of rewriting and refactoring
      of old-ass code. I've tested this as best as I could, but if you notice any
      bugs still, please don't hesitate to make a bug report!
  - rscadd: Trying to put an item in the wrong slot via the stripping menu now gives
      an explicit error message, so as to not waste your time.
  - tweak: 'Buffed the Pickpocket''s Gloves: Their effects now apply to all storage
      slots, not just ID and pockets.'
  - rscadd: You can now toggle someone's suit sensors via the stripping menu, without
      having to remove their jumpsuit.
  - tweak: There is now one unified option to toggle other people's internals via
      the stripping menu, which is available even if they have a tank in their pockets
      or hands.
  - tweak: 'Simplified the way toggling internals chooses a tank: It will now simply
      look in your suit storage, then back, then belt, then pockets, then hands. It
      will also only take internals from a jetpack as last option.'
  - bugfix: Fixed items in your pocket slots not applying their on_found() effects
      (e.g. mousetraps) when stripped individually, only when your jumpsuit was stripped.
  - bugfix: Fixed items in your pocket slots not applying their on_stripped() effects
      (e.g. SPS) when your jumpsuit was stripped, only individually.
  - rscdel: Removes the ability to perform CPR on alien larvas. Sorry guys.
  - bugfix: Accidentally fixed bug where you could spam CPR and do CPR multiple times
      at the same time in the same mob. Sorry guys.
  - bugfix: Fixed borers (or any other simple animals you can't control normally)
      never decreasing their deaf/confused/blind timers, thus being forever deaf/confused/blind.
  - bugfix: Borers will no longer be blinded by flashbangs if their host has flash
      protection (since they're seeing out of their host's eyes and whatnot).
2016-06-19:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed the first Xenoarch large artifact ever scanned becoming forever
      unmovable if a second large artifact was scanned afterwards or if the analysis
      was cancelled.
2016-06-20:
  DrCelt:
  - bugfix: fixes asspies to not contain spiritbreaker to bring behaviour like assburgers
  DrCelt / Intigracy:
  - bugfix: (DrCelt) Fixed a bug where species damage modifiers were applied twice.
  - tweak: (DrCelt) As a result of this, brute/burn modifiers are slightly less effective
      when it comes to resistance/weakness (less damage resisted, less damage taken,
      respectively)
  - tweak: (Intigracy) Dionae burn damage is an exception, it has changed from 6.25
      to 6.2
2016-06-21:
  Icantthinkofanameritenow:
  - bugfix: Fixed Vox Engineer hardsuit helmets lacking welding protection.
  - bugfix: Vox atmospherics hardsuits should protect against plasma exposure and
      fires like they're supposed to.

      beerkegs wrenchable.
  Shadowmech88:
  - tweak: The utility borer's fleshshot now requires 10 chems to fire if the borer
      is using it to swing an item. It costs nothing if the host's hand is empty.
  - tweak: Utility borers are now incapable of using their fleshshot while their host
      is stunned, or has silicate in their system.
  - rscadd: Borers will now take damage while their host has sodium chloride in their
      system, and will die from it after roughly 40 seconds.
  - rscadd: Borers now slowly regenerate health while inside a host.
  - rscadd: Borers can now see their health in the status tab.
  - tweak: Plasmamen now take 1.5x brute damage.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added a new hostile monster - legionary hoppers. Their ability to leap
      on top of their foes makes up for their slower speed. The hostile infestation
      event can bring up to 8 of them to the station.
  - tweak: 'Tomb of Rafid updates:'
  - rscadd: Added a new area - the Water Gallery
  - bugfix: Fixed rock walls creating cold vacuum, fixed being able to crowbar water
      turfs
  - tweak: Slightly reduced damage done by fire blasts (affects fire traps, jackal
      firebreathers and pyromaniacs)
  - bugfix: Fixed cyborgs being able to use ladders. They can still enter the tomb
      through the second entrance
2016-06-22:
  DrCelt:
  - bugfix: Changed behaviour of grey telepathy to not be awful and highly exploitable.
  - tweak: You now have to hear someone speak locally - in other words, you have to
      see their speech bubble, before you can telepathically communicate with them.
  - tweak: The name chosen to represent them in the menu is the one you heard them
      speak as.
  - rscadd: If you examine someone they will be added to your options as well.
  - tweak: You can no longer discover if someone is dead by trying to send them a
      message.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Diona burn mod is now 2.5 again. Apparently the way burn mod was applied
      before wasn't as expected.
  Ririchiyo:
  - wip: added dectalk
  Shadowmech88:
  - tweak: Food items can now be loaded into the blunderbuss and the cannon. Drinks
      can as well, as long as the container isn't open.
2016-06-24:
  Sood:
  - rscadd: Aliens can now alt-click on mobs to spit neurotoxin at them.
  - rscadd: Aliens can now ctrl-click on other aliens to transfer plasma to them.
  - tweak: Spit neurotoxin now has a cooldown. Yes, it didn't before. That's how clunky
      that menu was.
2016-06-25:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed wallets hiding your identity when worn in your ID slot even if they
      had an ID put inside.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: There is now a more noticable difference between knives and kitchen knives
      now, the former is known as small knife and has a new icon. It still doesn't
      work for making swords.
  Shadowmech88:
  - imageadd: Added new borg sprites for the standard, service, security, and combat
      modules, courtesy of Dizor.
  Unid:
  - bugfix: Fixed mobs standing up when they shouldn't be able to, and not standing
      up when they should be able to
2016-06-26:
  JustSumBody:
  - rscadd: Quick equip will now prioritize placing items into equipped belts over
      pockets and suit storage.
  Unid:
  - bugfix: Crushing locked crates by shuttles now destroys their contents as well.
2016-06-28:
  Sood:
  - rscadd: Adds a marker. The necromorph kind. Currently admin spawn only.
  - rscadd: Players can click on the marker with their bare hand to become a necromorph,
      or drag another mob onto it to turn it into a necromorph.
  - rscadd: Ghosts can sign up to be a necromorph by clicking on the marker. They
      will take control of the next mindless necromorph to spawn.
  - tweak: Player necromorphs can now open doors.
2016-06-29:
  Kurfurst:
  - rscadd: Added three new Vox plants to fill missing botanical niches, Slippery
      Pitcher Plants, Aloe Vera, and Vapor Sacs.
  - rscadd: Added Box (plural Boxen), freakish boarlike livestock for Vox to farm.
  - rscadd: Added a Box Flesh Cloner and the Box meat it runs on, with which to clone
      fresh Box babies. Surely recloning the same meat again and again over untold
      generations won't cause the rise of some antediluvian horror.
  - rscadd: Added seven new Vox food recipes, bacon, pork tenderloin, sweet and sour
      pork, hobo burger, welcome pie, zhu long cao fan, poached aloe, mint, vapor
      stew.

      to turn reagents to gas.

      Contraband, Boxen starter kit added to Premium
  - tweak: Special thanks to all the spriters who contributed to the Vox hydroponics
      project, most prominently Inorien.
2016-06-30:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Reverse-stripping items into monkeys is instantaneous again.
  - tweak: Reverse-stripping items into humans is now 50% faster, since 4 seconds
      per slot is very tedious and the shorter time is not really very exploitable
      anyways.
  Kurfurst:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug with inheritance that caused woodapples to be reharvestable
      infinitely
  - tweak: Based on feedback, reduced vapor salt production significantly.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where any plant with images in hydroponics2.dmi would disappear
      when modified. These included diona nodes, Vox plants, cinnamonum.

  - bugfix: Phazon floors now affect all types of mobs, not only a few of them
2016-07-07:
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: The admin spawnable autogibber now actually works. I recommend not walking
      into it, trying to touch it with a tool, or trying to touch it with your hand.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Double agents now have a 20% chance to receive an objective to assassinate
      a civilian (non-antagonist). When such an objective is given, another double
      agent receives an objective to protect the civilian.
2016-07-10:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Added boot knife holsters. Currently, they can be found inside Security
      lockers, and come preloaded with a 10 force knife.
  - imageadd: Boot knife holster sprites courtesy of Blithering. Tactical knife sprite
      stolen from Bay when noone was looking.
  - tweak: The Biogenerator can now make handgun holsters, as well as the new boot
      knife holster.
  - tweak: Medals and ties can now be attached to spacesuits, armor, and anything
      that goes over your chest. Because why not?
  Faptastic:
  - rscadd: The service borg dice have been replaced with a digital die, change dice
      type via alt+click or yellow button.
  Intigracy:

      3 seconds.
  - tweak: Cult blades found through Xenoarchaeology no longer require you to be a
      cultist to use them. As a result, they also have only 15 force as opposed to
      30.
2016-07-13:
  PJB3005:
  - rscadd: Gave the tile painter the ability to clear decals on a tile.
2016-07-14:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to set someone else's suit sensors through a hardsuit.
      Also made the 'set suit sensors' button smaller to prevent accidental clicking
      when mashing every button on the strip menu after you stun that guy.
  kolith:
  - rscadd: Adds a secway vehicle. It behaves as a janicart, except that you crash
      into things and are stunned for a short time if you are clumsy or very drunk.
  - rscadd: Adds a foam armblade toy. It can be acquired as a prize from an arcade
      machine.
  ultraPLEN:
  - rscadd: Added modular couches contstructable from metal sheets.
  - bugfix: Fixed an overlay issue with roller chairs
2016-07-17:
  PJB3005:
  - bugfix: Fixes the R-UST and shield generator circuits being broken and unable
      to be built into machinery. You've got the author of Bus Station to thank for
      that.
2016-07-18:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed MoMMIs being able to drop held items while ventcrawling, which would
      make the dropped item magically pop out on the floor above the vent.
  JustSumGuy:
  - bugfix: 'The High-res camera module for Malf AI now once again lets you read lips
      as long as their mouth is unobstructed. '

2016-07-22:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where limbs that had burn damage would not be severed from
      the body via brute damage. This was most commonly seen when trying to decapitate
      people that were lasered.
  - rscadd: Trying to put a brain in a MMI now produces a special message telling
      you to try again if the brain has ghosted but can still rejoin their body, much
      like how cloners work with corpses. When this happens, the ghosted player will
      get bwoinked and told to rejoin their corpse.
  - bugfix: Fixed the message you get when examining a brain, which was supposed to
      differentiate brains with a player still inside and brains belonging to a ghosted
      player.
  - bugfix: Fixed Diona nymphs not regenerating health from bright lights. Note that
      their health regen is much much slower than grown Diona. Did not 'fix' the way
      they take damage from darkness, meaning they still pretty much just don't.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Supermatter crates ordered from cargo now cost 500 credits, as opposed
      to 100.
  JustSumGuy:
  - bugfix: The 'Box Cloner' is now properly built from a machine frame rather than
      a computer frame.
  - tweak: Removed the overdose limit on imidazoline, and by extension carrots.
2016-07-24:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: All-in-One Grinders will now try to start grinding their ingredients when
      alt-clicked, and only eject their beaker if no ingredients are loaded (previously
      they would only eject their beaker).
  JustSumGuy:
  - bugfix: Made the food tray more like a table, add items to trays by clicking on
      the tray with the item in hand. Trays drop all their items upon being placed
      on a table,thrown, or dropped.
  mph55:
  - bugfix: Fixed an unreported bug which items removed from the switchtool were stuck
      on your hands after being picked up.
2016-07-27:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed Vox Raider dart guns not firing when clicking on a turf, which made
      aiming hell. Also, to prevent confusion and birdbrains unwittingly firing empty
      darts, the dartguns start mixing reagents by default.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - tweak: All chairs, wooden and metal, are now worth 1 sheet (both construction
      and deconstruction), down from 5/3/2/1 (Office, Wooden, Comfy, Normal)
  JustSumGuy:
  - tweak: Vampire's enthrall ability now requires both the vampire's and the target's
      masks to be removed. Enthrall can no longer be used while restrained.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added pop out cakes - enormous cakes that are big enough for a human to
      hide inside. Inside of it is a one use party string - pull it to sound the party
      horns and graciously climb out of the cake. Cutting them with a knife produces
      edible slices.
  - rscadd: Pop out cakes can be bought for 3 telecrystals by nuclear operatives,
      or cooked in the microwave using 15 milk, 45 flour, 6 eggs and 6 sheets of cardboard.
  mph55:
  - bugfix: The character preview is no longer blurry.
2016-07-31:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Trying to clone a husk now provides a more informative error message, rather
      than the generic 'mental interface failure'. This message also tells you if
      the dead guy can still rejoin their corpse, so you can try to clone a husk before
