      their own from scratch! Each species has their own wild hive.
  - rscadd: Wild hives work like normal ones, except that you cannot add queen bee
      packets or beezeez, or empty bees into them.
  - rscadd: Added Hornets. They have a chance to spawn from infestation events, and
      traitor botanists may purchase Hornet Queen Packets for 2 TC each. Hornets have

  - bugfix: Made sure that nuked hives won't spawn more bees.

      or queen packets for the first 20 seconds of their existence. So if you place
      a hive after deconstructing an apiary, you know it won't get stolen by a queen
      from another apiary.
  - tweak: Homeless queens have to be in the wandering state for 20 seconds before

      down from 10 minutes.
