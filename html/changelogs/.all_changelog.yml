2019-02-08:
  DrSnips:
  - rscadd: Ammolathes are now mapped in and can be found in most armories. A design
      disk has also been added to the warden's room so research can obtain the ammolathe's
      design. This design is limited to the disk.
  Goldsteel:
  - rscadd: Adds 20 new pill colours to the chem master. Toggle them on and off at
      your leisure.

  dylanstrategie:
  - rscdel: Blink spell (both Wizard and Vampire) no longer fills the origin and destination
      point with a huge plume of smoke. Instead, the origin of the warp will be clear
      of visual effects (pending a kickass animation or such) and the destination
      will have one-tile smoke to make the Wizard's destination more visible.
2019-02-10:

  I-VAPE-VOX-CLOACA-EVERY-DAY-OF-MY-LIFE:

      because someone butchered 2000 chickens!
  - bugfix: Fixed proximity sensors not detecting (or detecting in extremely buggy
      ways) anything that wasn't a mob. This may have slight balance implications
      since you can chuck a pen towards them to activate them, so do definitely make

      (15 or less).

      5 seconds (was 20 seconds). A bit faster teleport, maybe -someone- will pick
      the spell now
2019-02-11:
  I-VAPE-VOX-CLOACA-EVERY-DAY-OF-MY-LIFE:
  - bugfix: The Janitor's trash bag can now hold up to 21 items, as intended. To prevent
      it from becoming the ultimate belt slot container, it will slow you down if
      it's too full and worn on belt slot (won't slow you down if you're just carrying
      it or if you clip it to your janicart)

      unusual fragrance.
  - rscadd: The fragrance of a stick of incense can be changed by using an incense
      oil container, which can be obtained at the PietyVend along with more boxes
      of sticks. Adding certain flowers to the oil container let you change the fragrance
      applied to the incense.
  - rscadd: Incense sticks can be light up just like a cigarette, however they will
      retain their remaining combustible when extinguished.
  - rscadd: Incense sticks can be placed inside a thurible, which gives them a bit
      of extra duration. The thurible also comes with a built in lighter.
  - tweak: the vampire smiting abilities of the null rod have been moved over to the
      thurible (since it's made of silver). Null rods can still disrupt their powers.
      Thuribles also deal brutal damage to undead simple animals, such as zombies.
  - bugfix: The character preference preview now properly displays chaplains with
      laceups shoes.
  - rscadd: The cult holomap is now accessible from altars, and displays the position
      of other cult buildings and runes. Path runes are color-coded by word. Of course

  - rscadd: Added the first purely Chaplain traitor item, the Feldbischof's Bible.
      This bible handily disguised AND functioning as your holy book of choice comes
      with an extra bonus in the form of an authentic (made in China) loaded Luger
      P08 and an extra magazine. 16 rounds of pure converting power, like back in
      the day. It costs 14 points to buy, discounted at 10 for practicing people.

  Kurfursten:

      bombs in their ship, only Nuclear Emergency (roundstart Nuke Ops) do.

      of the trader in question rather than you, the reader.

      one costs slightly more than a regular RPED but with diamond cost thrown into
      the mix.

      spell (deals 25 burn damage and requires you to wear the entire clothing set),
      a telekinesis injector, and a jump mutation injector. Shouldn't mean you should

  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Bees can now path above farmbots.
  - tweak: Queen bees now take up to a 60 seconds (up from 20) to decide to build
      a new hive if there are no empty apiaries available.
  - tweak: Bees trying to reach plants or mobs but having their path blocked will
      eventually grow tired/bored, and go home. Or start roaming if they don't have

      pocket.
  - tweak: However, shakers bought at cargo are now discount shakers that don't have
      this new behaviour. Those found in asteroid ruins however do.
  - rscadd: The station holomaps have been updated to feature markers for not just
      the bar, but also the chapel, the library, the courtroom, and most importantly
      the HoP's office!
  - rscadd: The PDA station map app has been revamped to work just like a portable
      station holomap. It still gives your coordinates when used, but you may no longer
      place markers on it, but frankly until there is a significant demand for it
      I'll bury that feature. On the bright side this means it now works on all maps
      and automatically updates with all map changes.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Captain's PDA having two Virtual Wallet and Balance Check apps.

  - rscadd: You may now deconvert a Greytide Implant slave by removing the implant,

  - tweak: Some religions now start with different incenses.
  - rscadd: Your total sportiness ranking (from consuming sports reagents) now allows
      you to land dunks (both of the hoop and disposal variety) reliably, and adds

      new crew will be clowns.
  - rscadd: Since most of the giant spiders were exterminated, carp have begun to
      nest more freely among the 'roids. Crew are advised to be more cautious of deep
      space.

      damsel in distress?
  - rscadd: Added waifu and secfu corpses which other mappers may find useful.

  - tweak: Sending one midround wizard now costs 20 threat (down from 50) and destroying
      it refunds 10 (down from 40).
  - tweak: Blobstorms are now much cheaper, require less extreme conditions to fire,
      and get a fake meteor warning at first (as well as more delay before announcing
      it was a blobstorm after all); roundstart blobs remain the same

      added

  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Exosuit fabricators can no longer print instantly when fully upgraded
      due to the multiplier for the time it takes to build objects being 0.

      multiplier in order to have clean-looking costs due to unintended interaction
      of level 1 default research in the multiplier calculation.

      nothing, but now it will make you regenerate twice as fast but make you go hungry

      or picking a talisman using the radial menu. This does NOT bring up the pop-up.

      It has to be the real deal vodka ala tunguska triple distilled, not derivatives
      or knock-offs!
  - tweak: The more russian you are, the bigger the explosion when it inevitably decides
      to blow up instead of reducing the explosion!
2019-03-05:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that let a crew-member that refused conversion be designed
      as sacrifice target the instant before they get devoured.
  - tweak: Removed the cooldown on sacrifice target re-roll, instead, any cultist
      may now force a re-roll at an altar by communing with Nar-Sie if the target
      either had their body destroyed, or fled the station's Z level. This means that
      the cult may now confirm that their target is still around the station.
  - tweak: Added a bunch of flavor text when progressing to Act 1 or getting converted
      to remind cultists how to summon their own Arcane Tome.

      magic wand like a wizard staff or null rod to make a rabbit appear.
  - rscadd: Added rabbits. They don't do or say much other than look cute.
  Exxion:
  - bugfix: Fixed two ancient bugs that caused fires to burn hotter and release more
      CO2 than intended. Fires in general are now much colder and produce much, much
      less pressure. This affects bombs as well. Since six years of balance happened
      since these bugs were introduced, some numbers are probably going to have to
      be tweaked.
  SirSkeleto:
  - rscadd: Harm attacking a cablecuffed spaceman will NO LONGER break the cablecuffs,
      and instead stab the target.

      against foes that are armed and against which you should _really_ tase first,
      and ask questions later. Sprites courtesy of @otatoh."'
2019-03-09:
  Exxion:
  - tweak: Almost doubled energy released per mole of reactant in fires, again. This
      should bring bombs and burn chambers back to roughly where they were before,
      or only slightly lower. This also affects all other fires, but any time the
      ratio of reactants to total gas is low, they'll still be far weaker than before.
      (If you see this message but don't observe the effects in-game, blame whoever
      merged the PR)
  Irradiation:
  - tweak: Malfunctioning AIs can now occur dynamically midround with incredibly low
      odds. Dead/Low Lowpop can't roll midround MALF.
  MadmanMartian:

      it removes the lockdown upon death.

      from a medihud, and not a records console.
2019-03-10:
  bathosbathtime:
  - rscadd: Permagunk is now enabled.  Garbage and cleanable messes will now last
      up to five rounds.
  - rscadd: Any round ending antag that destroys the station, like nuke ops or cult,
      will cause the next round on that map to be shiny and clean.
  - rscadd: Janitors get one extra cleaning grenade in each janitor closet (room)
      per 100 gunk tiles from the previous round
2019-03-11:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Roundstart ruleset weights have been adjusted. Overall there will be more
      traitors, less nuke ops and malf.
  - tweak: High danger (potentially round ending) roles have had their ruleset costs
      increased, which lowers the chance of them happening at the same time.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused two roundstart rulesets to proc at population
      levels that should never allow it.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixes the Sith bundle Sith Lightning appearing in the wizard's spellbook
      instead of the normal Lightning. Sith Lightning is weaker than normal Lightning
      (deals half damage).

  - tweak: The character preference window will now tell you what color your skin
      tone is instead of just a numerical value

  - tweak: You can no longer pull a hologram/daki (but you can still destroy it!)
  MadmanMartian:

      speech.
  - rscadd: Greys are now properly immune to sulphuric and polyacid
  - rscadd: Adds descriptions to the symptoms of viruses. These are viewable through
      analysis of the virus.

      civilization. Xenoarchs are recommended to look for parts that are compatible
      with current machinery.

  - tweak: Using a communicate rune mid-cast will allow you to write a "Cult reminder",
      which will be engraved in the memory of all present cultists and all new converts.
  - tweak: Bloodcult now requires security members to start.
2019-03-15:
  PJB3005:

  MadmanMartian:
  - bugfix: In the event of the crew successfully defeating a blob infestation, the
      lockdown will ACTUALLY be lifted.
  - bugfix: Fixes some worn items not appearing on some species. Now it will use the
      normal human sprites, so there will be irregularities, but it beats the icon
      not showing at all.
  - tweak: The method of repairing a broken vending machine has been made more obvious.
  eplgr:
  - tweak: Body bags now take time to open and close when there's someone inside standing
      up

2019-03-17:
  GeneralVeers25:

      who is dead but not ghosted.

  - rscadd: For roundstart blob only, Clowns may select Clownscape, Chaplains may
      select Skellington, and Engineering staff may select AME.
  - rscadd: Ninja gloves now drain anything with a cell (incl tasers, eguns, cyborgs,
      mechas). If they are on cooldown or the target has less than 100 charge, you
      will interact with the target normally. Feel free to headpat that unpowered
      borg.
  - rscadd: Wearing ninja gloves renders you untrackable by an AI.

  Kurfursten:

      them.
  - bugfix: Summon guns once again gives guns to all
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug in which the Donutgiver could only be swapped on

  - rscadd: When joining as chaplain, you will be prompted as to whether you'd like
      the traditional book design and deity of your religion. If the answer is yes

      faster.

      have granted janitors the ability to understand the speech of mice and rats.
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: A bunch of broken religion keys, like science, now work
  - rscadd: Objectives can now exist as a delayed type where the target is chosen
      later. Assassinate is delayed 10 minutes for most antags (but not for revolutionaries).

  MadmanMartian:
  - rscadd: Default alternate job option is now return to lobby, rather than get random
      job.

  DeityLink:
  - experiment: As our player numbers have soared in the past week, Dynamic Mode which
      had been designed to support populations oscillating between 5 and 50 players
      has basically kept picking mode as if we were being permanently at Threat Level
      100, as far as roundstart rulesets are concerned at least. Therefore a new alternative
      configuration has been put in place that puts more weight on the Threat Level,
      and less on the player population, with the goal to bring back some variety
      to our rounds, and less Nuke+Malf+Blob at every or so roundstarts.
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: Loose catbeast antagonists are now black cats.
  MadmanMartian:
  - bugfix: The ghetto space helmets icon states now work
2019-03-26:

      Structure, Communication, Summon Tome).
  - rscadd: Trying to use a rune before the Act allows it will now also remind cultists
      of their current objective.
  - rscadd: The cup found in cult coffers is now called a tempting goblet. It will
      always refill the blood vessels of cultists drinking blood from it, regardless
      of blood type.
  - rscadd: Non-cultists drinking blood from it however will always get toxins instead,
      as well as suffering from hallucination, red view, jittering, dizziness, and
      a short version of the Confusion rune's effects as well.
  - rscadd: Throwing the goblet will splatter its content on the floor, but if someone
      gets hit by it and their mouth isn't covered, they'll take a gulp first.
  - rscadd: the Raise Structure rune now uses a Radial menu specifying that the Spire
      and Forge are unlocked at Act 1 and 2 respectively.
  - rscadd: Added an admin debug button to easily skip Cult Acts.
  - rscadd: Added some extra info to the cult scoreboard at the end of the round,
      such as the highest count of bloody floors reached.
  - tweak: Asteroid floors, the Vox outpost, vaults or the prison no longer allow
      blood spill progress during Act 3. Sorry Roid cultists.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Shortcut Tracer tattoo HUD icon.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Cult appearing as "successful" on the scoreboard if all its
      current objectives were posthumously completed after the cult had already been
      defeated (such as blood getting spilled after the cult lost)

      oxygen tank to go with it.

      when appearing.
  - tweak: You no longer need harm intent to cut walls with weapons that allow you
      to cut walls (currently melee energy weapons) because the feature was too obscure.
      You still need harm intent for cutting airlocks!
  - tweak: 'Antimov lawset now has a capitalized "must". It looks like this: "MUST".'
2019-03-29:
  Kurfursten:

  - tweak: Department accounts lowered to 500 (750 for station account)

      around department accounts

      still stutter from Act 1 onwards).
