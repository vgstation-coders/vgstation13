  - bugfix: 'Deff: Fixed Defficiency''s engineering escape pod having messed up corners.'
  - bugfix: Roid's messed up brig atmos has been corrected.
  - tweak: Mobs wearing the cardborg helmet now have the appropriate speech verbs.
      You will "state" speech instead of "saying" it, "query" instead of "ask", and
      "declare" instead of "exclaim".
  - tweak: Medical and security records now consistently display information on a
      crewmember's sex.
  - bugfix: 'Syn: Fixed Synergy''s library''s scrubber line.'
  - bugfix: 'Syn: Fixed Synergy''s ERT shuttle.'

      a method of transforming her as a player.

  - bugfix: Fixed runtime when non-mob objects speak.
2023-06-17:

2023-06-18:
  DeityLink:

      all instead of only the first one.
  nervere:
  - bugfix: Fixed hair not properly updating sometimes when a player's head is destroyed.
  - bugfix: Energy swords meant to have a pre-determined color now work correctly.
2023-06-20:
  DeityLink:

      step on them while they're conscious.
  - rscadd: The Vacuum Dishwasher from the Vox Traders' Zinc Saucier's crate now has
      density, improved visual and audio feedback reflecting its state or when vacuuming
      and cleaning plates, as well as some minor bugs fixed.
  nervere:
  - bugfix: Fixed instruments breaking when a song has a space (comma) at the end
      of a line

      on that tile. This functionality is available for all types (normal, advanced,
      cyborg, etc.).

  - rscdel: Removed redundant and broken refresh button on janitor PDA cartridge.

  pedr69:
  - rscadd: AI's now get an audio beep when requested at a holopad
2023-06-24:
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Getmore and Discount Dan's have started stocking their machines with mint
      candy. Getmore sells a pack for 30 credits, while Discount Dan's sells them
      for a coin, as it is one of the rare non toxic items they sell, and that cuts
      into profits. The old vendortron somehow got access to a homemade brand of mints.
  - rscadd: Mint Essence, only available inside mint candy, it is the unrefined version
      of Mint Toxin, being perfectly safe to consume.
  - rscadd: Mint Toxin and Mint Essence will keep you minty fresh. This helps with
      heat (like drinking iced coffee) and gives you an ever so slight boost to sports
      performance (same level as sugar).
  - rscadd: Being minty fresh and drinking ice water might cause dental pain. Drinking
      coffee immediately afterwards will cause some less than desirable effects to
      your dental health.

  - tweak: Made the NT icon for the NT mints blue, instead of green.
2023-06-27:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Regular blob tiles once again (after 7 years) visibly brighten when a
      pulse passes through them. Pulses are emitted by Cores, Nodes, and Overminds.
      So if you see some nearby blob blinking brightly despite no Node being nearby,
      that means the Overmind currently has their attention on you. Hopefully it shouldn't
      cause more CPU usage this time.
  - rscadd: Blob Cores and Nodes now emit light, whose color depends upon which skin
      has been selected
  - tweak: The Blob Core and Node pulse animations once again render above darkness,
      like they were meant to.
  - bugfix: Fixed Blob turning shuttle tiles black when expanding over them.
  - bugfix: Fixed some roundstart Blob ruleset initialization issue that could lead
      to the blob getting extra antag roles if multiple roundstart rulesets fire together.
  - bugfix: Fixed some animations (such as the cult teleport animations) ending about
      a second earlier than they should.
  - bugfix: Parallax wraparound has finally been fixed, you will no longer leave stars
      behind forever if you keep moving in one direction in space.
  - bugfix: Fixed hookshots and their chains not being visible in many cases.
  - bugfix: Fixed hookshots having a much shorter range when firing in diagonals.
  - bugfix: Fixed hookshots failing to properly reel you in if the hook hits something
      at the longest range possible.
  - bugfix: Fixed a sanity issue that occurred when mobs exit a Cryo Tube, Body Scanner,
      DNA Scanner, Mecha, or Cyborg Recharging Station through teleportation or getting
      pulled by a hookshot chain, and that would either allow other players to teleport
      them back to it, or just prevent the object from being used by other players.
  - rscadd: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Players that have no roles when the clock hits the automated
      ERT call now become Survivors. Latejoiners that don''t have Traitor enabled
      get that role as well.'
  - tweak: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Changed some of the messages sent to latejoin traitors
      to have them better notice that this isn''t a regular antag roll.'
  - tweak: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Attempting to call the ERT early will now always result
      in a failure (note that it won''t prevent the automated ERT call to occur after
      20 minutes).'
  - tweak: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Reduced the ERT call delay from 20 to 18 minutes (so the
      ERT may actually arrive at the Station after 20 minutes)'
  - tweak: 'ANTAG MADNESS: During that mode, the Blob-related biohazard announcement
      will now trigger much later, but the Blob will also be unable to spawn any additional
      Blob Cores.'
  - bugfix: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Fixed Nanotrasen Officials not getting their Survive objective
      unless they latejoined.'
  - tweak: If a faction's defeat is supposed to reduce the security level and call
      the shuttle, it will only do so if no other faction also has the shuttle under
      lockdown or warrants a higher security level.
  - imageadd: Added a new logo and Greeting message for Survivors that aren't created
      by Wizards summoning guns.
  DorainGrey:
  - rscadd: Adds a radio for Nukies, where they can request reinforcement and get
      extra TC in exchange for waiting 10 minutes during the ensuing bluespace distortion.
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: There is now an art vendor. Coming soon to a library near you.
  - rscadd: The librarian can now request the removal of a book from the library database
      with a button. Do your civic duty and delete the garbage.

      the checkout computer.
  gurfan:
  - bugfix: Product lists can now be imported into cash registers again.
  jellyveggie2:
  - rscadd: Pressure valves can now also compare temperature, and have been renamed
      to conditional valves.
  - tweak: Conditional valves can now also compare the control pipe against the input
      pipes' gases, rather than just a fixed value.
  - tweak: Conditional valves can now also forego the side input entirely, using either
      of the two other pipes as control. This might help make some designs neater
      and more compact.
  - rscdel: Conditional valves can no longer be controlled via AAC, beyond simple
      on/off commands.
  nervere:
  - rscadd: Deadchat is now notified when and where a player dies, with an option
      to jump to that player's location.

  - rscadd: 'LOWFATBAGEL: An additional exit to atmospherics has been added to make

      slime puddle.
  - bugfix: Arcane Tampering is now properly cleared from all objects when a wizard
      dies.
  - bugfix: Fixed orange hardhat sprites being at an incorrect position for insectoids.
  - bugfix: Slimepeople can be cloned once more. Simply put the slime puddle inside
      the cloning machine and scan. Make sure it has its slime core (brain) inside
      or it won't work!
  - tweak: Slimepeople now take toxins damage when cloning instead of clone damage.
      This is to prevent them from instantly cloning (as they're immune to cloneloss),
      while also providing a way for xenobio to ease their cloning process (through
      giving them a slime heart).
  - bugfix: The PDA pinpointer will no longer display negative values when showing
      the time until its next scan.
  smonkeM:
  - rscadd: Added one new reagent, one new spray bottle, and added this to the AutoDrobe's
      contraband section
  - rscdel: Apparently I deleted two lines somewhere. And then added two lines. I'm
      an idiot and I don't believe this breaks anything?
2023-07-01:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Mobs can now attack blob tiles empty handed. Obviously puny humans won't
      do much damage at all given its inherent resistance to brute damage, but at
      least this allow mobs like aliums and constructs to do decent damage to the
      blob. Blob tiles also now take damage from thrown objects.
  nervere:
  - bugfix: Fixed light replacers not being able to replace bulb-less light fixtures
  - bugfix: Fixed runtime when a light fixture's fitting var is set to null for some
      reason (???)

      a whole, instead of each individual layer.

      getting soft-locked in case the jaunt finds itself off-track, or stuck on things
      like photobooth.

  - bugfix: Fixed the "Jump to Blob Core" button at the top left of the screen of
      Blob players not working properly.

      from very high and low temperatures.

      glasses equipped in most cases when their job outfit already includes some glasses,
      even if those had a prescription version.
  - imageadd: Prescription Health Scanner HUDs have a new sprite and are now called
      Health Scanner Glasses. They can also now be printed at R&D, and both them and
      the regular Health Scanner HUDs can be found in medical lockers.
  - rscadd: Added Sporks to the game. Metal ones can be obtained from the Dinnerware
      as a premium item, while plastic ones can be crafted from plastic sheets.
  - imageadd: Forks, Spoons and Sporks now all have in-hand icons.
  Eneocho:
  - bugfix: Mint boxes no longer have pill bottle overlays, this time for real.

  - imageadd: Additional outfits for observers.
  Inorien:
  - tweak: Gas tanks eject the same way on tank dispensers and gas canisters (to hand)

  - rscadd: Snow Station's Station Holomaps have been enhanced, and now display the
      locations of the Taxi docks on the station and the orbital platform.

      display the station's level, while others display the asteroid's level.
  - bugfix: Fixed planetside Vaults being visible on Snow Station's holomaps.
  - tweak: Now that Snow Station's asteroid arrivals outpost has Station Holomaps,
      the asteroid's mined out areas have been made a bit blurry to make its true
      form a bit subtle.
  - bugfix: Medical Orderlies now spawn in Medbay at round start on Snow Station,
      instead of the Arrivals Shuttle.

  - tweak: The salvage ship's captain buried his riches among the rocks of the asteroid.

  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added a new Traitor Uplink Item, Canned Heat! Raises the temperature of
      the surrounding atmosphere by 1000 Kelvin. Discounted for Atmospheric Technicians
      and Chief Engineer traitors. Every player in the affected area will get a sound
      and chat warning. Used inside an inflatable shelter will raise its cabin atmosphere's
      temperature instead.
  - bugfix: Fixed plastic spoons and sporks not having in-hand icons.
  - bugfix: Fixed the issue where hobo shacks could lack an APC if two of them spawned.
      Each shack is now properly its own area.

      feet.

  - bugfix: Fixed AIs being able to see at a higher invisibility level than their
      intended one.
  - rscadd: Station Holomaps now feature a button on their interface that you can
      click to find your workplace. The button only actually appears if you actually
      have your workplace on the displayed Z Level, and are wearing identification
      featuring a valid rank.
  - rscadd: The Bhangmeter now functions like a Station Holomap. Touching it displays
      a map of the station over which are displayed the areas affected by explosions.
      Recent explosions appear bright and opaque, then slowly fade away over 5 minutes
      until they remain at half transparency. Incoming meteor/object waves and the
      direction they come from are also indicated.
  - rscadd: You can access the new Bhangmeter panel featuring a table of all recorded
      explosions by clicking the Database interface button visible on the holomap.
      Explosions are recorded from most recent to oldest, and per Z level, so if you
      want to see the Asteroid's explosions, you'll need to use a Bhangmeter on the
      Asteroid Z level.
  - rscadd: Explosions caused by the Pipe Gun (aka Blast Canon) now spread in a cone
      shape. Just like with regular explosions, each affected tile now checks for
      things that could dampen the explosion between them and the epicenter.
  - rscadd: The round-end scoreboard now gives the round's largest TTV explosion,
      with an extra mention if it reached maxcap.
  - imageadd: Added additional in-hand sprites for TTV depending on which tanks are
      on them.
  - imageadd: Improved the Pipe Gun (aka Blast Cannon)'s in-hand sprite, and added
      a variation for when it has a TTV equipped on it.
  - imageadd: The Bhangmeter has a new sprite, finally differentiating it from the
      Detective's Forensic computer.
  - bugfix: When the bhangmeter announces information, it does so by "coldly stating"
      which it hasn't done since at least 2016.
  - rscdel: As they were mostly broken and unused, and extended greatly the duration
      of roundstart initialization, NanoUI minimap generation has been disabled. The
      only feature that still uses them is the Central Atmospherics Computer which
      will now display its markers over empty space when you display its Tracking
      Map. In return, we've shaved off 10-20 seconds of roundstart init.
  gurfan:
  - tweak: Added Hawaii tourist uniform sprites for Vox/Insectoids/Greys
  nervere:
  - imageadd: New HD item icon for the Funk Boots added, all spritework done by Blithering.
2023-07-17:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixes roundstart players appearing naked on their medical and security
      records
  - tweak: Plasmamen using the Summon Robes rune now actually get cult robes. The
      old armor that used to spawn can still be purchased from traders, and now actually
      provides cult benefits when equipped.
  - tweak: When using the Summon Robes rune, plasmamen now keep their plasma tank
      in their suit slot. And when using the blood tesseract, their cult suit and
      hood are now deleted and replaced with the suit and helmet they had stored in
      it.
  - bugfix: Fixed Cult Armor and Helmets not regulating the body temperature of plasmamen
      or extinguishing them.
  - imageadd: Plasmaman Cult Armor and Helmet are now animated.
  - bugfix: Fixed monkey clothes not having their in-hand sprites show up.
  - rscadd: Added Winter Cult Robes and Hood for all species (even monkeys). Those
      will appear in place of regular robes when using the Summon Robes rune on the
      snow Z Level.
  - bugfix: AIs using their Station Holomaps on other Z Level will now see the proper
      map (and as it is for regular Station/Cyborg Holomaps, only the Station, Asteroid,
      and Derelict Z levels have detailed maps)
  - bugfix: Prescription Glasses once again properly transfer their effect to Mesons
      or similar glasses put over them.
  - bugfix: Fixed some glasses that were meant to have corrective lenses not actually
      having them (prescription diagnostic HUD and hydroHUD).
  - tweak: Touching a Station Holomap that you are currently already watching now
      makes you stop watching it.
  - bugfix: This makes it so that you won't get extra non-removable Workplace Finder
      buttons on your screen.
  - experiment: Dynamic rulesets now have their weight increase linearly round after
      round until they get to proc, upon which it gets reset to 1 (at round end).
