      Still allows for the same functionality as the table too.
  - tweak: Heavily modified the list of weapons available at round end.

      for now.

      will target a random nearby mob. The projectiles don't damage anything beside
      mobs.
  - rscadd: Added bee nades. Self explanatory.
  - tweak: Bees no longer despawn when they don't have a home apiary.

  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Fixed gold slime monsters attacking adamantine golems.
  - bugfix: Improved a bunch of code related to hostile mob target acquisition.

      cloning less cramped.
  - tweak: Added two mining vending machines and an ATM to the mining outpost, repurposed
      the room in cargo to a delivery/storage room from which cargo techs can take
      the ores the miners bring from the asteroid to deliver to the rest of the station
      and store drills R&D made for the miners or whatever just be the usual goys
      and ignore it entirely then complain about it having no point or turn it into
      some dank disco break room for cargo. Your imagination is the limit.
  - tweak: Removed the research shuttle entirely and replaced it with break room.
      The mining shuttle now covers both the mining and research outposts.
  - rscadd: Added two security suit storages units to the armory.

  - bugfix: Borers can hear from inside of their hosts again.
  Wizardcrying:
  - bugfix: Disallows the destruction of a janicart's trashbag and its contents by

  - rscadd: Replicators and autocloners can now be destroyed by damaging projectiles
      or by being hit with weapons of force higher than 10. Their destruction produces
      a small (but damaging) explosion.
  PJB3005:
  - bugfix: Made ventcrawling through layer manifolds less of a pain; you now get
      aligned to the third layer if you're crawling in the direction with only 1 pipe.
  Probe1:

  - tweak: Except Paramedics.  They have a sick ass suit already.

      one containing an engineering hardsuit.
  - bugfix: Funny enough, there was always a defib, blood bag, and first aid kits
      on the shuttle.  However, the defib locker was acting as a container for them
      and there was no way to get them out.  This is fixed now!
  ShiggyPiggy:
  - rscadd: The surgeon's switchtool is now constructible (and deconstructible) in
      the protolathe.

  - bugfix: Fixed spacevine and biomass events being borked and not properly triggering.
      Welcome back spacevines random events.
  - tweak: Trying to convert a cult-banned player will now force them asleep for 10
      minute and give the cultist who tried to convert them an explicit message about
      it. This doesn't convert loyalty implanted players.
2015-11-15:
  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Fixed xenomorph sprites not updating after they drop/throw an item.
2015-11-17:

  - tweak: 'Cameras are now even easier to upgrade: just screwdriver the maintenance
      panel open and jam the upgrades in. No wiring required.'
  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Fixed (maybe) a bug that caused small explosions animations to keep re-appearing
      on the same turfs when leaving the area and coming back.
  - tweak: Explosions now affect furthest turfs first and closest ones last, which
      makes explosion obstacles as reliable as they were intended to be.
  - tweak: Improved the EMP method. Allowing for station-wide EMPs that don't lag
      the server.
  - rscadd: Supermatter Shard delaminations now cause a station-wide EMP. The EMP
      ripples slowly from the epicenter to the outskirts.
  ShiggyPiggy:
  - bugfix: Anti-Toxin (Dylovene) is now just Dylovene.
2015-11-18:

  Intigracy:

2015-11-25:
  Kurfurst:
  - tweak: The food crate has been renamed to "basic cooking crate" and now contains
      more flour at the cost of no bananas or malt vinegar.
  - rscadd: 'New crate: "Fruit crate", contains a large assortment of fruit at random.'
  - rscadd: 'New crate: "Exotic garnishes", contains a random selection of all kinds
      of goodies, ranging from coco to honey to soysauce and more. There might be
      something special, too. Requires kitchen access.'
  - rscadd: 'New crate: "Trophy meats", contains all sorts of exciting meats for bored,
      advanced chefs. Requires kitchen access.'
  - rscadd: New recipes for Malt Vinegar and Sprinkles.
  - tweak: Refactored Dropper slightly
  - rscadd: 'New premium item at the kitchen vendor: baster! It''s a big dropper.'

  - rscdel: Removed the non-exotic seed crate, as the vendor recharge packs obsoleted
      it.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where, although some hydroponics crates had access requirements,
      they did not actually use a crate which could use access requirements.
  - tweak: Removed hydroponics access from some harmless crates.
  - tweak: Wrapping paper is now a stack, with all of the benefits that entails (merging,
      disappearing when used up)
  - tweak: Tweaked the amount per use of wrapping paper
  - tweak: Gift wrapping a person is no longer instant, but also no longer requires
      a straight jacket. It takes a long time (triple handcuffs).
  - tweak: Cargo techs (and the QM) now have access to Syndicate Wrapping Paper. This
      very cheap traitor item wraps people up to be indistinguishable from boxes and
      much faster than normal wrapping paper. They can still talk inside (if alive),
      but they can't bust out without help.
  - tweak: Wrapping paper is now a size smaller - pocket compatible!
  - tweak: Gifts of all sizes now fit on the MULE
  - rscadd: A new motorized wheelchair is available from Cargo. It's expensive, and
      it runs on a battery. You can still use it if the battery runs out, but it's
      slow. Instead, replace the battery with a screwdriver and crowbar!
  - rscadd: 'A new medical doctor traitor item: The Medical Malpractice. This wheelchair
      comes with a hyper cell and is modified to run over unsuspecting crewmembers.'
  - tweak: Time-release pills are now NOREACT.
  - bugfix: Xenoarch machines can now have their panel opened and be moved about with
      a wrench. By extension, you can now deconstruct them and upgrade them.
  ShiggyPiggy:
  - rscadd: The CIA outfit has been added to IAA's office locker. Call it in, you
      big guy. Credits to Skowron for the sprite.
  Unid:
  - tweak: Mimic meat now transforms when injected by 5u blood. It no longer transforms
      when hit by a rolling pin.
  - rscadd: Injecting a golden slime core with water spawns a mimic after a slight
      delay. The resulting mimic's shape and size is affected by the objects closest
      to it. Putting the core in a crate will create a crate mimic, dropping it near
      a bunch of items will create an item mimic, and holding it in your hands...
      What would that do?
  - imageadd: Added sprites for holding baby carps and corgi puppies
  - imageadd: Added sprites for holding cats and kittens
2015-12-01:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a PDA in your hands/PDA slot will now eject it's pen. Much
      faster than right-clicking or hunting down the verb in the Object tab.
  - rscadd: You can now also ctrl+click a PDA in your hands/PDA slot to eject it's
      ID.
  Faptastic:
  - rscadd: Added 'Blood' transmission vector for virus samples.
  ShiggyPiggy:

  - bugfix: Rapid Service Fabricator is no longer put on a table when fabricating
      objects on one.
2015-12-02:
  Kurfurst:
  - tweak: The Syndicate Wheelchair now moves slower than a person (instead of equal
      speed), deals 25% less damage, costs +1 TC (total 6), does not have an enlarged
      power cell, and deals no damage to arms or head zones.
  - bugfix: Welding a scrubber now costs 1 fuel (instead of 0)
  - bugfix: Scrubbers now properly change sprite when welded
2015-12-03:
  Probe1:
  - tweak: (Box) Botany Backroom has been reworked to allow for more space.  We lost
      some maint space.
  - tweak: (Box) Significantly redesigns Research Outposts Botany room.  It now has
      botany machines and generally doesn't look like a hole in the wall you were
      sent to as punishment for picking Research Botanist.
  - tweak: (Box) The security disposal bin closest to the Warden is now where packages
      will exit when shipped through disposals.  Mind the bombs please.
  - bugfix: (Box) Adds a new APC and area to Perma.  It is now called Permanent Confinement
      rather than just part of the prison wing.  This should partially mitigate the
      prison wing running out of power so quickly.  It may need further tweaking so
      please report in if it is a problem area still.
  - rscadd: (Box) Mailman outfit hidden in maint.
  - rscadd: (Box) Adds two pairs of magboots to the research outposts Expedition Preparation
      Room.
2015-12-04:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: 'Added a new, rare, super special, un-limited edition prize to arcade
      machines! Hint: It''s the bomb! Ages 8 and up.'
  ArthurDentist:
  - rscadd: Added the 'Summon Robes' spell. This spell will allow you to summon a
      new set of robes and doesn't recquire wizard gear to cast.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - experiment: Chemistry-Reagents.dm has had a code refactor, which means I had to
      go through every single reagent. If any chemical seems to behave oddly, please
      contact an admin for a VV
  Kurfurst:
  - tweak: Following feedback, the Contortionist's Jumpsuit is now 4TC (down from
      7)
  - tweak: The Modified Flaregun is now available to a trator Chief Engineer
  - tweak: The Syndicate Wheelchair now moves slower than a person (instead of equal
      speed), deals 25% less damage, costs +1 TC (total 6), does not have an enlarged
      power cell, and deals no damage to arms or head zones.
  - bugfix: 'Voice Changer now inherits flags_inv from the spite you have selected
      for it (e.g.: cigarette will no longer hide your face/glasses)'
  Probe1:
  - bugfix: (Meta) Squashes over a half dozen bugs, from disposal mail not working
      for security to the brig cell locker not working and a dozen other little things
      like cargo not having metal/glass at roundstart.
  - tweak: (Meta) EVA was redone based on player feedback
  - tweak: (Meta) Research Outpost Botany was greatly expanded and is on par with
      the one on Box
  - tweak: (Meta) Firewall removed from the turret controls outside the AI Core foyer
      it shares with telecomms.
2015-12-06:
  Probe:
  - rscadd: (Meta)Added a deskbell to cargo.
  - tweak: (Meta)Adjusted the singlo containment field to prevent silly stuff.
  - tweak: (Meta)Replaces the invulnerable shuttle window on Security Escape Pod with
      a full compliment of reinforced plasma windows.  This opens up a way into security,
      but is more secure than the windows in perma.
  Probe1:
  - rscadd: Adds the Arnold Palmer, a non alcoholic drink made from 1 part tea and
      1 part lemonade.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Trees may be cut down with sharp and big enough objects, yielding from
      3 to 8 big logs.
  - rscadd: Trees fall in a random direction when chopped down. Standing in a large
      tree's way is a sure way to get some broken bones, and you can see the direction
      in which the tree is going to fall before it's cut down.
2015-12-07:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: You can now lock conveyor belt switches to one direction only by using
      a multitool on them. You can also unlock roundstart ones to work in both directions,
      because why not, you could already do it by deconstructing and reconstructing
      the switch anyways.
  Pomf123:
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to pick up dionae that are buckled to something such
      as wheelchairs or the janicart which lead to hilarious teleportation antics.
2015-12-08:
  Exxion:
  - rscadd: Light replacer has been completely overhauled. It now actually contains
      storage for lights and storage for waste lights, which it automatically picks
      up. It can be loaded the same way as before or by removing its box and replacing
      that. It ONLY accepts light bulb/tube boxes. The rest should be self-explanatory
      from its menu (accessed by clicking it in your hand).
  - tweak: The material costs of most types of lights have been changed slightly.
      Standard tubes are the same, bulbs are half as much, and the HE variants require
      three times more glass (but not iron) than their standard counterparts. Also,
      the large tube and fire bulb were adjusted, but you almost never see them anyway.
      Even the most expensive light is still a small fraction of a sheet of each,
      though.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added brass knuckles and spiked knuckles. When worn as gloves, they slightly
      increase punch damage and knockout chance. However, they reduce your dexterity,
      making it necessary to remove them for operating computers and some machinery.
  - rscadd: Brass knuckles may be purchased by traitors for 1 TC, spiked knuckles
      may be found in the smooth operator syndicate bundle.
2015-12-10:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Sleepers, DNA scanners, Body scanners, and Cryo pods now allow patients
      to have "abiotic" items in their hands. Items that get trapped inside the machine
      (dropped by the patient while inside) will just get ejected together with the
      patient.
2015-12-12:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed Poly not learning from hearing people, and thus only ever saying
      his default lines.
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to electrolyze Silicate.
  - bugfix: Mann's Drink is now properly counted as a soda can for the purpose of
      IEDs and electrolyzing.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added hardcore mode that can be enabled by admins during (or before) a
      round. When enabled, starvation has many more side-effects than usually (including
      death).
  - tweak: Sleeping humans lose nutrition 75% slower.
2015-12-13:
  9600bauds:
  - experiment: Massive rework to Botany mutations and Botany in general. PLEASE remember
      to use the in-game reporter for any bugs/issues you encounter! The changes here
      are not final and feedback is appreciated.
  - spellcheck: 'This changelog is a very simplified version, it does not cover all
      the changes. To see the full changelog, check out the PR in Github: https://github.com/d3athrow/vgstation13/pull/6734'
  - rscadd: Added 6 new plant traits, as well as many new non-stat mutations. A few
      plant traits that could previously only be obtained through Cargo exotic seeds
      can now also be obtained through mutations.
  - experiment: Some mutations will have effect on the grown fruit and require special
      handling. If you see a mutant banana lying around on the hallway, you may want
      to examine it before touching it.
  - tweak: Botany stat mutations will no longer give random stat penalties. All stat-related
      changes from mutations are now strictly positive.
  - rscadd: 'For stat-increasing mutations, the strength of the mutation will be directly
      proportional to the amount of mutage used. Example: 10u mutagen will improve
      a stat twice as much as 5u would. Mutations are now 100% guaranteed for any
      amount of mutagen, just that small amounts will give weak mutations.'
  - rscadd: 'New mutation system adds a bit of depth to mutagen usage: Using more
      than 10-ish units of mutagen at a time will give you potentially dangerous effects.'
  - tweak: As you improve your plants, they will start to build up resistance to small
      mutagen doses. Past a certain point, you may experience diminishing returns
      from mutations, and you may want to use bigger dosage (though be wary of the
      potential for dangerous results!)
  - experiment: Adult plants WILL NO LONGER MUTATE SPECIES. To cause species mutations,
      you need to add mutagen to a young plant (less than 60ish seconds of life).
      For a better explanation, see the full changelog.
  - tweak: Robust Harvest no longer temporarily increases yield. Now gradually improves
      your plant's potency stat, with a couple subtle downsides. Diethylamine now
      makes your plant grow faster, as well as gradually increase it's lifespan an
      endurance. Clonexadone massively heals plants on trays, as well as induce rapid
      reverse aging.
  - rscadd: Floral Somatorays now work 100% of the time. You can now right-click them
      to change the strength of the ensuing mutation when set to "Induce Mutations"
      (X mutation strength is equivalent to X units of mutagen). Now sometimes give
      a free yield-increasing mutation when under "Induce Mutations" mode.
  - rscadd: Hydroponics Trays will now change their name to match the plant growing
      in them. You can now label trays by right-clicking them.
  - tweak: Improper plant conditions (not enough water/nutriment/light etc) will now
      slightly slow your plant's growth.
  - tweak: A few changes to Exotic Seeds to make them slightly healthier and slightly
      more fun.
  - tweak: 'Spreading plants (i.e. Kudzu) will no longer leave an empty tray when
      planted. Now require being fully mature before spawning vines. You can prevent
      vines from spawning by keeping the plant fed: Kudzu won''t try to spread unless
      it has less than 80% nutriment and water.'
  - tweak: Plant-b-Gone used as a spray now targets space vines in a 3x3 area around
      itself. Scythes now have a 1 second cooldown when used. Added a Heavy-Duty Pneumatic
      Scythe, can be attached to Ripleys. Some strains of Kuzdu can become resistant
      to certain types of damage through mutations.
  - rscadd: 'Xenobotany gene injector now has two modes: Splice and Purge. Added two
      more Xenobotany genes, and modified existing ones somewhat.'
  - tweak: Condensed Capsaicin now requires Capsaicin and Ethanol to produce.
  - tweak: IV Drips now give their increased transfer speed to any container that
      has only blood inside, rather than only IV bags.
  Kurfurst:
  - tweak: Getmore foods are now valued at price = 66% * nutrition value (e.g. SOS
      Jerky has 6u nutriment, so it costs $60). Syndiecakes remain free.
  - tweak: Dan foods are valued at 16.5% * nutrition value. Overall, they became cheaper.
  - tweak: Bustanuts remain free, but no longer contain nutriment. A good source of
      salt and hardcores.
  - tweak: Ramen costs much less than its nutrition value ($15) but has limited stock.
      Dan ramen is less filling but proportionally cheaper ($2)
  - tweak: Cargo Pizza now costs $15 per pizza, so a full pack of five costs $75.
      (Together, they will provide 150-250 nutriment, a value of ~$2000)
  - rscadd: You can now hack Discount Dan machines to buy antitox pills.
  - tweak: Flour sacks by default now contain 50u flour.
  - rscadd: The food processor can butcher toxic meats to carefully remove the toxin
      sacs.
  - rscadd: New items containing poison within poisonous meats. Butcher them out!
  - tweak: Removed bonus poison from cooked poisonous dishes. Meaning if you butcher
      out the poison from the components, the final result will not be toxic.
  - tweak: Most carp dishes now include pheromones as a bonus
  - rscadd: Added a new alcoholic beverage- Pina Colada
  - rscadd: Added several new food items- Rice ball, Risotto, Sushi, Chicken Tendies,
      Coleslaw, Honey Flan
  - rscadd: Firing a pneumatic cannon loaded with food at a person will cause them
      to take a bite if it hits.
  - rscadd: Tea purchased at a machine now comes in one of several thrilling varieties.
  - rscadd: Hacking a Boozeomat will now unlock coffee and mug options.
  - rscadd: The reagent scanner now also tells the exact number of units of each component.
      Scan your food and find out what's worth cooking!
  - tweak: Removed Vending Delay from the Boozeomat, as it was intended for machines
      with an animated vending sprite.
2015-12-14:
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: added a snow turf for use in mapping which has a bunch of cool shite like
      -40c unsimulated and a snow noise but can't be arsed to elaborate more
  - rscadd: added campfires, fireplaces & stoves. if you walk over a campfire you
      get set on fire. they act as heaters which rely on wood, and you can warm your
      hands on them.
  - rscadd: added a spit to roast food on, just have over a lit campfire and hit it
      with food to rotisserie it.
  - imageadd: thanks to Nienhaus for snow sprites and the new wooden door sprite.
  - imageadd: thanks to DragonBro/Bad_Spriter for snow paths.
  - imageadd: thanks to Eliminator for fireplaces, spits, & campfires.
  - imageadd: thanks to Niggly for stoves.
2015-12-16:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Fixed the "Space Travel Gear" button in the Sandbox menu giving you empty
      jetpacks, and upgraded the spacesuit that you get from said button to a NASA
      voidsuit.
  - tweak: You will now see speech bubbles from people who are speaking inside mechs,
      lockers, and generally everything.
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to wipe Xenobotany disks while they were inside a machine.
  - bugfix: Fixed Xenobotany machines having wrong part requirements for building.
  Blithering:
  - imageadd: Added a stormtrooper outfit & blaster
  - rscadd: Added a security-to-stormtrooper modifier which turns lasers & sec hardsuits
      into their stormtrooper equivalent.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added \"assembly frames\", items that allow creating more advanced things
      with assemblies like timers, signallers and speakers. They can hold any amount
      of assemblies inside, and the assemblies inside can be connected together.
  - rscadd: Assembly frames can be found in vendomats (costing one coin), or created
      with protolathes. Each mechanic's locker starts with two assembly frames.
  - rscadd: Added addition circuit assemblies. Whenever they receive a pulse their
      internal counter is increased by 1. Whenever their counter reaches a specified
      value, it resets and the assembly emits a pulse.
  - rscadd: Added randomizer circuit assemblies. When pulsed, they randomly select
      a specified amount of assemblies connected to them, and emit a pulse to them.
  - rscadd: Added comparison circuit assemblies. When pulsed, they check the first
      assembly connected to them. If the condition is true, they emit a pulse to the
      second connected assembly, otherwise they emit a pulse to the third connected
      assembly.
  - rscadd: All of the new assemblies can be made with autolathes.
  - tweak: Timers and proximity sensors now start or stop countdown when pulsed.
  - tweak: It's now possible to set \"default time\" on timers and proximity sensors.
      When their timers finish counting down, the time remaining is reset to the default
      time.
2015-12-17:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: RPDs will now create pipes in the layer and the direction that the RPD
      was set to when the pipe started building, rather than when it finishes. This
      means you can effectively place multiple pipes in different layers and different
      directions at the same time.
  - tweak: Asteroid mobs can now be damaged by sufficiently powerful Pneumatic Cannon
      shots (and, presumably, really strong throws)
  - rscadd: The Tile painter will now paint tiles with the decal that the Tile painter
      was set to when the tile started painting, rather than when it finishes. This
      means you can effectively paint multiple tiles at once with different decals,
      though always within the same category.
  - sounddel: Less annoying and less LOUD sound for the Tile painter.
  - rscadd: Added pocket sand.
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: When suiciding with a gun, a sad song will play in your immediate area.
2015-12-19:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed harmbatons and potentially other attacks not working properly.
  Clusterfack:
  - rscadd: Emotes can now be seen inside objects, thanks saycode optimizations!
  - bugfix: Hologram pads will also be able to see emotes for the AI now
2015-12-20:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Probably fixes a critical bug related to force-feeding people that resulted
      in invisible food sticking to your hand, as well as allowing for the potential
      of infinite slipping and infinite runtimes.
2015-12-25:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Cleanbots will now clean most types of cleanable decals (the kind of shit
      you clean off the floor with soap), rather than only a few select ones.
  - tweak: By default, Cleanbots won't clear crayon drawing or graffiti. They can
      be set to do so by touching their controls.
  - bugfix: Fixed some nanoUI machines displaying a buffering icon and not responding
      for a couple of seconds after pressing a button on their interface. If the problem
      still persists in some machines I didn't see, please don't hesitate to make
      a bug report.
  - rscadd: The Sound Synthetizer now uses a popup list to choose between sounds.
  - soundadd: Tweaked some Sound Synthetizer sounds that were particularly hard to
      hear to make them a bit louder. Also disabled random pitch in a couple of Synthetizer
      sounds that normally do not have randomized pitch, so they sound a little more
      closer to the real deal.
  - soundadd: Added 4 sounds to the Sound Synthetizer, each one more annoying than
      the last, at least two of which may have comedic potential.
  - bugfix: Probably fixed Kudzu being a little buggy when killed extremely fast,
      such as with a chemsprayer.
  - rscadd: Updated the exotic seed random reagents to have weighted randomness for
      some reagents.
  - tweak: Advanced slime mutation toxin is now very rare in exotic seeds. Slime mutation
      toxin and slime jelly are now less common, as well.
  - tweak: Added Methylin, Dexalin Plus, Carp Pheromones, Mint and nothing as possible
      exotic seed reagents.
  - tweak: Un-snowflaked Ambrosia Cruciatus. This means that it's now possible to
      splice Spiritbreaker into other plants through Xenobotany, however, exotic seeds
      that produce Cruciatus leaves won't have Spiritbreaker anymore.
  ArthurDentist:
  - rscadd: Borer eggs can now be ordered from Cargo. Each egg crate contains 1 egg,
      costs 100 credits and requires Xenobiology access to open.
  Clusterfack:
  - bugfix: Heist works now, the objectives and not ending immediately upon sending
      the shuttle
  DeadPoolJ:
  - rscadd: Added a new core module board, CELTIC, which has one law, Be someone the
      crew can look up to and respect.
  Doobiedoo23:
  - rscadd: Adds a few sets of medieval armour, including crusader armour to the chaplains
      arsenal. Deus vult!
  - rscadd: Adds a crate to cargo under the security section allowing you to order
      knight armor
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: You can now construct wood lattices on snow and roid turfs as well as
      make wooden girders and platings.
  - rscadd: Wizards can now choose a santa wizard kit on christmas day only with a
      good deal of nice spells to use.
  Intigracy:
  - rscadd: You can now implant any carbon mob (this means no simple animals like
      corgis, but works on xenos) with implants. These do NOT show up on sechuds unless
      they are human, however.
  - rscadd: Implants now correctly transfer when you change between monkey/human (including
      changeling transform). This has been in the code forever but was not functional
      because monkeys couldn't be implanted.
  - rscadd: The above also applies for diona nymphs evolving into fullblown diona.
  - rscadd: Slimes who split will have the implant be in the one that gets (or would
      get) the mind of the splitter.
  - rscadd: Xenomorph's who are implanted will keep the implant through every stage
      of evolution.
  - bugfix: You can no longer cause items to delete by trying to pick them up while
      you're transforming into a insert mob other than human here.
  - tweak: You can't implant a traitor implant into someone who's loyalty implanted
      without first removing the loyalty implant. Pretty sure this was intended already,
      as it was checking twice for the same implant.
  - bugfix: You can now ventcrawl as normal even if you've got a borer inside of you.
  Kurfurst:
  - rscadd: Added a built in radio to the AI that has a captain level encryption key.
  N3X15:
  - rscadd: Santa can now turn people into coal golems.  They are adamantine golems,
      except made out of coal, and are autoslaved to Santa.
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: 3 new mobs for wintery or christmas bus, polar bear, snow crab (Celts
      suggestion) and gingerbread man (Thread suggestion).
  - rscadd: Assorted festive clothing (3 christmas jumpers, 2 santa hats)
  - rscadd: A crate for festivities (Said christmas jumpers and hats, gift wrapping
      paper, and a cracker)
  - rscadd: Added a sprite for the christmas cracker hat, and relocated it from christmas.dm
      to head/misc.dm
  SonixApache:
  - rscadd: New secHUD icons for mechanics, paramedics, IAA, incarcerated inmates
  - rscadd: 12mm ammobox, empty 9 and 12mm magazines protolathe options
  - rscadd: more empty magazine types
  - bugfix: HoP can now assign IAA agents properly
  - bugfix: Empty magazines now appear empty on creation
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added cockroaches that can spawn during the vermin infestation event.
      They are resilent, but weak to toxins (in form of smoke or sprays). They also
      lay eggs under food.
  - tweak: Animals are now slightly damaged by acid sprays or smoke.
  - tweak: Tiny animals like mice and cockroaches no longer drop gibs when butchered.
  - rscadd: Added math circuits. Usable in assembly frames, they possess a wide range
      of mathematical functions and can process both constant values (numbers) and
      variable values (other assemblies, for example timers)
  - rscadd: Added read-write circuits. Usable in assembly frames, they can read, store
      and modify values of various assemblies
  - experiment: Both of the new assemblies can be printed using the autolathe
  - tweak: Reworked comparison circuits. Order in which assemblies are connected to
      them no longer matters, and both sides of the equation can be variable or constant
  - tweak: Assemblies in assembly frames can be pulsed by clicking on an uppercase
      P next to them
  - tweak: Voice analyzers may be muted by hitting them with a multitool. They also
      are no longer triggered by sounds coming from assembly frames.
2015-12-27:
  Zth:
  - soundadd: Added few sounds
2015-12-28:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Added Choco-Coins, available in Getmore's vending machines, or can be
      made with one chocolate bar and 5 milk at a microwave.
  - imageadd: Choco-Coin sprites courtesy of a generous Anon in the general.
  Intigracy:
  - rscadd: Slimes now keep their names when they evolve or split.
  - rscdel: Slimes are no longer named baby or adult due to the above. If you can't
      tell the difference you can examine the slime instead.
  N3X15:
  - rscadd: Added blattogenesis effect to viruses.
2015-12-29:
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added light tile remotes - devices that can remotely change colour and
      state of light tiles. They're compactible with assemblies and assembly frames,
      and can be built by protolathes.
  - rscadd: Up to five assemblies can be connected to the atmos automation console.
      Connected assemblies can be activated using the Assembly - Pulse command.
2015-12-30:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Added tech levels to many common items, so that they can be scanned with
      the Device Analyser. Notorious additions are PDA cartridges, Laser Tag equipment,
      Hookshots, Straightjacket/Muzzle/Blindfold, Pill collectors, Hailers, Modkits,
      and Shoulder holsters.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - experiment: Added meteor types. All sorts of fun new meteors might spawn depending
      on wave type, with special effects
  - bugfix: Fix meteor spawning proc causing some meteors to hit Z-level transition,
      and causing small waves to be 60 % smaller than intended
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: People who are turned into statues and shattered are now gibbed instead
      of turned to dust.
  TheEliminator16:
  - rscadd: Added a new child of bear called "Skrite". Adminbus only mob that hits
      like a bear and is twice as tough as one. Skrites move considerably slower than
      bears, on account of having only one leg, but make up for it with a toxic projectile
      attack.
  - imageadd: Added skrite sprites to animal.dmi
  - imageadd: Added skrite sprites to animal.dmi (used the correct animal.dmi this
      time, sorry niggly, I fucked your pudding)
  Unid:
  - tweak: When reading a newscaster, clicking on a photo will show you its description
2015-12-31:
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: Borers now transfer when their host is transformed. Depending on the new
      mob they become, you might be dropped. For admin transformations you always
      get dropped.
  - tweak: Mobs with borers in them are no longer immune to the staff of change.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added superglue. It can be applied to any item to make it unable to be
      dropped. Undroppable items can't be put in machines, thrown or dropped. However,
      they can still be eaten, disassembled or (in case of stacks) separated.
  - rscadd: Clown and mime traitors may purchase a bottle of superglue (one time use)
      for 3 telecrystals.
2016-01-01:
  DeadPoolJ:
  - rscadd: Made a new admin verb, Send Fax, which lets admins send a fax without
      having to reply to one first.
  - rscadd: Made faxes and prayers show up in the special window if admins have it
      enabled.)
  Dylanstrategie:
  - bugfix: Chemistry has been broken for nineteen days, so badly that you couldn't
      splash reagents on people, objects or turfs. Nineteen fucking days, and it took
      Sarah fucking Johnson to come back from the dead to report it
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Subjugation no longer lasts for upwards of 10 minutes. It now lasts 3 minutes
      per cast.
  Unid:
  - tweak: Animals can only be butchered on help intent now.
2016-01-02:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Combat messages (X has attacked Y with Z) will now show up in a bigger
      font for the player that was hit. For now this only applies to most melee attacks,
      if you come across a message that you feel should be made bigger for the affected
      player, don't hesitate to make an in-game report.
  - tweak: External blood loss has been slowed by 25%, though you'll still lose roughly
      the same amount of blood.
  - rscadd: Lying down will reduce the amount of blood you lose from external bleeding
      by 30% (This goes a longer way than it sounds). If you can't stop the bleeding,
      your best bet is to lie down and call for help or have someone drag you.
  - tweak: Tweaked low blood level warnings to give a little of a warning transition
      between "mostly fine" and "going into shock".
  - tweak: Slightly tweaked the effect of low blood levels, previously medium blood
      loss would be deadlier than heavy blood loss. It will still kill you pretty
      dead.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - rscadd: Singularity Beacons now have an internal battery. It will last one minute,
      which allows you to either set up a quick beacon without wires, or continue
      dragging when the Singularity knocks out the powernet
  - rscadd: The Singularity Beacon now glows red when on. This means it will be far
      less concealable in darkness, and shouldn't be adjacent to a wall (due to the
      way lighting works)
  - tweak: Singularity Beacons now needs to be wrenched down instead of screwed down.
      Cable is connected on hand interaction (interact again to turn on and off) and
      disconnected by wrenching or unwrenching
  - tweak: Singularity Beacons now need 500 W/s to run, and actually drain that amount
      from the grid
2016-01-03:
  ArthurDentist:
  - rscadd: Added a new artifact which can be found through xenoarcheology
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Double Agents will no longer be given the die a glorious death objective.
      Instead they have a chance to get the escape alone objective.
  Wizardcrying:
  - tweak: Viruses no longer mutate their effects when their host catches some radiation.
      This change actually dates back to Nov. 10, 2015, but it was never added to
      the changelog until now.
2016-01-04:
  Duny:
  - rscadd: Added a borer egg and a plasma canister to xenobiology. Two portable air
      scrubbers have also been added in xenobiology maintenance.
  - bugfix: Fixed glass doors on the derelict not being dense.
  - bugfix: Fixed solar APCs not charging.
  - rscadd: Added a coin press to the asteroid.
  - tweak: Modified the morgue's layout, more trays and less empty space.
  - tweak: Fixed up a bit the walls and rwalls around science to be more nanotrasen-approved.
  - rscadd: Added a light switch to hydrophonics.
  - bugfix: Fixed Mechanics Workshop vent not being connected to anything.
  - tweak: Added a few additional lights in science to make the hallway less spooky
      when one breaks.
  - bugfix: Attached the floating camera in xenobio to the wall.
  - rscadd: Added two cyborg analyzers to robotics.
  - rscadd: Added plant clippers in xenobotany.
  - rscadd: Added compressed matter cartridges in the bar storage, and replaced the
      shotgun with a double-barreled model.
  - tweak: Tweaked the starting charge of the SMES cells again. Might or might not
      be adequate since I still can't use SMES cells or APCs or anything else so I
      can't test it properly.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - tweak: Change Syndicate ammo box to contain a loaded speedloader, instead of an
      empty speedloader and an ammo box (with as many bullets)
2016-01-05:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Unsnowflaked Godblunts. This means that they will now have exactly the
      same reagents the plant had, nothing more.
  - bugfix: Fixed botany nonsense that could result in negative mols of a gas.
  - bugfix: Hopefully fixed the Reverse Engine and General Fabricator bugging out
      with any items that could be created in the Protolathe. There's a chance I've
      fucked this up, so if you notice any subsequent bugs please don't hesitate to
      use the in-game bug reporter.
  PJB3005:
  - experimental: 'Made map voting weight-based: if box got 75% of the votes, meta
      10% and deff 15%, those chances will be used to pick the map.'
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Light tiles now emit colored light
  - bugfix: Fixed newscasters eating photos
2016-01-06:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Ghosts can now read books by examining them when close enough. Ghosts
      can now also click a bookcase to read the books that are inside (without removing
      them from the bookcase).
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a reagent container (i.e. beaker) while it's in your inventory
      will now directly bring up the \"Set transfer amount\" menu.
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a Chemistry Dispenser will now directly eject it's beaker,
      if any.
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a portable scrubber or portable pump will now eject their
      held tank, without having to open their menu.
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a washing machine will now start it. Likewise for Centrifuges.
  - rscadd: Janicarts have now gained a \"Remove Trash Bag\" verb. Alt-clicking a
      Janicart will directly remove it's trash bag. Clicking a Janicart while you're
      riding it will no longer bring up a popup asking what you want to do, it will
      instead always make you stop riding it. If you want to remove the trash bag
      while riding it, use the verb or alt-click.
  - experiment: If you can think of any other alt-click shortcuts that you'd like
      to see in the game, please don't hesitate to write a letter, stamp it, and mail
      it to my house, but don't make a feature request or people other than me will
      have to read it, which gets them mad cranky.
2016-01-07:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: If a fruit naturally produces than 100 units of a chemical, it will now
      try to fraction the chemicals into 100 units, rather than discard the overflow.
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to dilute hydroponics tray toxicity by using water.
  - bugfix: Fixed General Fabricator not working with certain items (again), probably
      fixes General Fabricator trying to use acid when making circuitboards.
2016-01-09:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Diona pods now start with 35 durability. This means that they won't immediately
      die as soon as the lights are turned off or the tray gets weeds or something
      similar. This also means that, due to popular vote, Diona seeds are easily attainable
      by using plant clippers.
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: Adds the ability for ghosts to jump into borers with no ckey assigned.
      Just click on them as a ghost to check, but you do need to not have the spawnban
      from ghosting
2016-01-10:
  ArthurDentist:
  - rscadd: Added Eucharist Wafers which can be made in the microwave with 5 holy
      water and 5 flour. Seven also exist in the Chaplain's Vendor.

  Unid:
  - tweak: Boxing gloves now reduce dexterity, just like knuckledusters
  - tweak: Boxing gloves now double the chance to stun your enemy in unarmed combat
  - tweak: Graffiti may now be drawn on walls (although slightly slower).
  - tweak: Grass, planks, stacks produced from crafting or from the biogenerator will
      now automatically stack with each other (so harvesting from a tray with glass
      yields one stack with 5 grass tiles)
  xpcybic:
  - wip: The following changes apply to Taxistation.
  - tweak: Taxi docks are now U-shaped and have two entrances each.
  - tweak: Slightly enlarged cargo bay QM office, custodial closet, dorms, hydroponics,
      kitchen, bar, tool storage, atmos, pod bay, brig, toxins, xenobio, xenobotany,
      and head of staff offices.
  - rscadd: Added jetpacks in EVA, engi/cargo EVA, and engineering.
  - rscadd: Added borer egg, plasma canister, and injector to xenobio.
  - rscadd: Added second pair of airlocks to mining dock, to prevent depressurization.
  - rscadd: Added intercom next to bhangmeter.
  - tweak: Flipped the courtroom horizontally to make it more accessible to the public.
  - rscadd: Added solid plasma to engineering for PACMAN use.
  - tweak: Redesigned theater backroom as one large room.

  - bugfix: Fixed patient rooms not having their own area, causing their light switches
      to control medbay's lights.
  - bugfix: Removed duplicate disposal chute from R&D.
  - rscadd: Added botany machines to xenobotany.
  - rscadd: Added external airlocks to maint near genetics and sec/sci bridge.

2016-01-14:
  Pomf123:
  - bugfix: Fixed station vox not having sol common during heist and fixed heist vox
      having sol common.
2016-01-17:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed stackable items (metal rods, floortiles etc) only giving one item's
      worth of materials when recycled at an Autolathe, regardless of how many items
      there were in the stack. Also fixes metal rods and possibly more items having
      the same bug or not working at all in the Recycler. Given that this had been
      broken for over half a year with seemingly no reports, I'm obliged to say once
      again that if you notice anything weird with this fix, you should make an in-game
      bug report.
2016-01-18:
  Kurfurst:
  - bugfix: Extinguishers once again properly calm the heart of a rabid slime
2016-01-19:
  xpcybic:
  - wip: The following changes apply to Taxistation.
  - tweak: Enlarged engineering just a little.
  - rscadd: Added a singularity telescreen outside engine room.

  - tweak: Enlarged xenobio cells to 2x3.
  - tweak: Adjusted lights in several areas which were too dim.
2016-01-22:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed nested storage items (e.g. a box inside a backpack) closing their
      inventory when you move, even if you were holding the parent storage item.
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to use screwdrivers as ghetto surgery tools.
  - tweak: Added an error message when trying to use surgery to fix a bone fracture
      in a very damaged limb. This is to prevent the \"bone explodes immediately after
      being mended\" syndrome.
  - tweak: Will no longer place items on operating tables, which was really annoying
      because it would end up in accidentally dropping your surgery tools under the
      patient. If you really want to place an item on top of the operating table for
      some reason, you can throw it on top instead.
2016-01-23:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed trays not picking up items. Fixed trays not removing their items
      when dropped or thrown. Fixed trays picking up items bigger than w_class = 3.
      Also fixed trays picking up trays. Also fixed a tray-related gamebreaking exploit
      that allowed you to permanently delete the nukedisk. Also fixed a tray-related
      gamebreaking exploit that allowed you to put any item inside a backpack, including
      other backpacks, and load a backpack past it's maximum storage slots. These
      things were really broken, weren't they?
  xpcybic:
  - wip: The following changes apply to Metaclub.
  - rscdel: Removed the hot drinks machine from permabrig.
  - rscadd: Added a newscaster to tcomms control room, for easy AI access.

  - tweak: Moved the launch room intercom closer to the bhangmeter.
  - rscdel: Removed the sleeper blocking the infirmary door on the escape pod docking
      shuttle.

2016-01-24:
  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Cult objectives and stuff should work fine in Mixed mode now. Might require
      some live testing so please give feedback at github.com/d3athrow/vgstation13/pull/7813
      if you end up in a Mixed cult round.
  - bugfix: Fixed new blood splatters not properly replicating the DNA of other blood
      splatters on their same turfs unless the round is cult.
  TheEliminator16:
  - bugfix: Made brown gloves properly use the on mob sprite.
  - bugfix: Gave the detached limb sprite all four directions, just as god intended.

2016-01-25:
  DrCelt:
  - experiment: SUMMARY
  - rscadd: Heat transfer Rehaul
  - rscadd: Hypothermia added
  - rscadd: changes to things that cause cold damage
  - rscadd: space blankets
  - rscadd: ghetto space suits with space blankets
  - rscadd: thermal homeostasis regulator that when emagged becomes the mancrowave
  - tweak: changes to cryo
  - experiment: INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HEAT TRANSFER
  - tweak: removes useless variables heat_protection & cold_protection as these were
      in 99% of circumstances the exact same as body_parts_covered
  - rscadd: added a new variable, heat_conductivity to all items, determining how
      fast they conduct heat away from you
  - rscadd: added new procs to humans, sweat() & burn_calories() - Now whenever you
      use up nutriment, you generate heat, but can also expend nutriment to decrease
      heat.
  - rscadd: refactored how heat transfer away from humans worked ( see above)
  - experiment: INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HYPOTHERMIA
  - rscadd: added Mild Hypothermia (between 32 and 35C) - this results in shivering,
      minor slowdown and messages informing the player that they are cold.
  - rscadd: added Moderate hypothermia (between 28 and 32C) - Shivering stops, slowdown
      increases, may slur/stutter words, chance of dropping items in hand and collapsing
      temporarily, as well as a 25% chance of forgetting how to use machines like
      when braindamaged
  - rscadd: added severe hypothermia (24 to 28C), shivering stops, player is unconcious,
      pulse decreases to 30BPM and has a 25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, which
      decreases over time as you are still breathing.
  - rscadd: added profound hypothermia (less than 24C), pulse stops, player has a
      25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, does not decrease over time as they are
      not breathing.
  - tweak: CHANGES THINGS WHICH CAUSE COLD DAMAGE, including but not limited to coldingtons,
      cryokinesis, showers, goliaths, temperature gun, and chemicals which chill people.
      Foam fire extinguishers are not affected.
  - experiment: THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR
  - experiment: Please use this when taking someone out of cryo
  - tweak: When a person is dragged in, it will automatically begin stabilising, there
      is no need for more buttons to be pressed
  - tweak: Takes 5 seconds to heat/cool someone to 37C, which works out as quicker
      than shaking someone up.
  - rscadd: Can be emagged to allow for three extra settings - this process is extremely
      visible, and there is a different sprite for when an emagged function is used
  - rscadd: Can reenable security features to quickly unemag the device and Can bring
      the device to an emergency stop.
  - experiment: CHANGES TO CRYO
  - tweak: Cryo now releases someone at 23C instead of -12C (or 25C if they manually
      eject)
  - experiment: PLEASE USE THE THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR AFTER TAKING PEOPLE OUT
      OF CRYO
  - tweak: Manual eject time brought down from 2 minutes to 30 seconds to make it
      time-neutral
  - tweak: This means that, as the person is ejected below profound hypothermia, they
      will not breathe until they heat up a wee bit further. This is a positive change,
      as vox & plasmamen will no longer die from toxin damage/fire immediately after
      leaving cryo.
  - rscadd: People inside a cryo cell do not suffer from hypothermia until leaving.
2016-01-26:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: Admins can now specify which modes they want in Mixed (among the modes
      allowed in Mixed)
  - imageadd: Revamped fireplaces.
  - imageadd: Paper bins have a new default sprite. Their sprite is now different
      whether there's a blank paper, a written paper, or a cult talisman on top.
  - rscadd: You can now also read the top paper or identify which talisman (if you're
      a cultist) is on top simply by examining the paper bin.
  Zth:
  - bugfix: Fixed flatpacks dissapearing when unstacking them.
2016-01-28:
  Duny:
  - wip: Added a metric fuckton of firelocks.

  - tweak: (Taxi) Chef, bartender, and botanists now have access to each other's departments.
  - rscadd: (Taxi) Added emergency shutters in dorms and security.

  - bugfix: fixed a bug where you would get nullspace'd if you were in a spacepod
      and it were to be destroyed in some manner
2016-02-02:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Better solution to the 'bone explodes immediately after being mended' syndrome.
      You will now once again be able to fix bones no matter the damage level of the
      limb. If the limb is so damaged that it would immediately break again after
      setting the bone, it will now heal to just under bone fracture levels. Note
      that this effectively lets you heal brute damage on dead people.
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: Added a bunch of wiki links for every antag roles in the Character Setup
      window. Also separated actual antag roles from non-antag special roles.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Sol Common is now Galactic Common.
  - rscadd: Added a new human-unique language, Sol Common. (Doesn't actually look
      a thing like Esperanto but that's what it's based off of)
  xpcybic:
  - wip: The following changes apply to Taxistation.
  - tweak: Cameras at each taxi dock will now appear first in the security and AI
      camera list.
  - bugfix: Fixed access on bar maintenance.
  - bugfix: Fixed floating, broken APC in solars near cargo.
  - bugfix: Fixed emergency shuttle brig not counting against the "escape alive and
      free" objective.

      and some normal plating where there should be airless.
  - bugfix: Fixed barricade walls on derelict where there should be window barricades.
  - bugfix: Scientists now properly have access to xenoarch wing and research shuttle.
  - bugfix: Fixed cabling on antimatter engine SMES.
  - bugfix: Fixed med/silicon dock APC not being wired to grid.
2016-02-03:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to point at things, use some alt-click interactions,
      strip people, toggle your mask, and maybe use a few other verbs while on a vehicle
      or buckled to a chair.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Sol Common is now blue, and uses its old syllables (Mandarin+English)

  Unid:
  - bugfix: Hypnotise costs 10 blood (instead of 0), bat form costs 30 blood (instead
      of 0), chiroptean screech costs 30 blood (instead of 10), shadowstep costs 20
      blood (instead of 0)
2016-02-04:
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: Merged flags_inv and body_parts_covered
  - bugfix: Fixed clothing being contaminated undesirably
  - bugfix: Fixes a bunch of unreported bugs due to the nature of the PR varying from
      the HoP jacket the riot suit and the stallhelm. If there is a bug where a sprite
      was overriding where it should not have this SHOULD fix that
  - experimental: This SHOULD also prevent that type of bug ever happening again.
      Please bugreport if you notice any sprite errors
  - rscadd: Adds is_slot_hidden proc
  - tweak: Splits head thermal conductivity into three parts
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where agent gas masks would conceal identities when their
      mask should not have.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where bloody hands were always visible on examine
  - tweak: You now lose heat to an environment if you have an exposed limb, no matter
      how wrapped up the other limbs are.
2016-02-05:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: When making bottles at a Chemmaster, you will now be prompted to input
      how many bottles you want to make before being prompted to name the bottles.
      This is to keep consistency with making pills (prevent bottles named '3'), and
      also allows the bottles to be automatically named after many units of chemicals
      they contain.
  - rscadd: You can now alt-click Chemmasters and All-in-One Grinders to eject their
      beaker, if they have one loaded.
2016-02-08:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed Diona nymphs talking in monkey language, rather than in rootspeak.
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: Adds a noir genetics block which the detective starts roundstart with
      if he has selected the "Gumshoe" alternate title. This block turns the client
      black and white except for blood.
  NigglyWiggly:
  - rscadd: Adds pajama hats, which you can now find in the PJ closet
  - rscadd: Adds greaser outfits from the suit dispenser.
  - imageadd: Adds casual hoodie and jeans or casual hoodie and skirt.
  - imageadd: Adds a keyhole sweater
  - imageadd: Adds winter casualwear and spring casualwear to the wintercrate and
      mixet closet respectively
  Sood:
  - bugfix: Facehuggers will no longer fight eachother over a person's face.
  - tweak: Facehuggers will no longer impregnate hosts that are already impregnated.
  - tweak: Facehuggers now have a health var. Currently this is only affected by bullets.
      They will die in most of the ways they died before.
  - rscadd: Facehuggers will now acquire targets and walk to them, and hug them when
      they're close enough.
2016-02-09:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Slightly buffed the surgery speed bonuses of advanced surgery tools (laser
      scalpels, surgical incision manager).
  - tweak: Fix-o-Vein, bone gel, and bone setters now have the same size as other
      surgery tools, meaning they now fit in pockets and boxes.
  - tweak: Circular saws and surgical drills no longer fit in pockets or boxes.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Masks do not protect against facehuggers. Wear a face-covering helmet such
      as a RIG helmet or bio hood.
  - experiment: Helmets have a 50% chance to be removed on facehugger attacks. This
      is a temporary balance change, but may stay if it this turns out to be enough.
  - bugfix: Facehugger toys will not forcefully remove headgear or path on their own.
      They will still leap at you if you walk next to them though.
  - bugfix: Sterile/non-real facehuggers will not protect against virile or real facehuggers.
2016-02-10:
  Pomf123:
  - bugfix: Fixed russian revolvers acting stupid.
  - bugfix: Fixed right clicking a job pref not decrementing the priority.
  Zth:
  - soundadd: Six sounds added.
  - rscadd: Resisting fires now makes you roll on the floor.
2016-02-12:
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: Had to hand in my Pull Request to the Chief - He'd always had it out for
      me, and the code ain't ever been in my favour, not since the war anyway. I looked
      it all over once more, tryin' to get to the bottom of this mystery, but it ain't
      easy finding bugs in some downtrodden code like this.I thought of that paddy
      dame that showed up in my office last week, asking for me to help her. Said
      someone called 'Gene Ettics' went AWOL. I told her I'd do what I could, and
      that's why I'm here. I opened up my flask of brandy and took a sip. It was going
      to be a long night. Chief or no chief, I'm getting to the bottom of this case.
  - rscadd: Re-adds the Noir Block.
  Pomf123:
  - bugfix: Fixed sechuds seeing through masks.
  TheEliminator16:
  - rscadd: Added the "Hostile Infestation" event. Similar to the normal infestation
      event, though this time with hostile mobs
  - rscadd: Added "Silent Meteors" event. Adminbus only, not random, allows for admins
      to send meteors without a command report. I'm sure this will never be abused,
      ever.
  - rscadd: Added "Organic Debris Field" event. Similar to meteors except instead
      of killing everyone, it splatters the outside of the station with gore, body
      parts, organs, exploding corpses...
  - rscadd: Added "Mass Drunkenness" event. Causes everyone on the station to be drunk
      for less than a minute.
  - rscadd: Added "Mass Hallucination", "Silent Meteors", "Hostile Infestation", "Organic
      Debris Field", and "Mass Drunkenness" events to admin secrets panel. Any admin
      with +FUN can access them.
  - rscadd: Made "Hostile Infestation", "Organic Debris Field", and "Mass Drunkenness"
      events possible to occur randomly.
  - rscadd: Added necromorphs.
  - rscadd: Added "spider queen", a large version of the nurse spider with a projectile
      attack that creates web where it lands and a lot of health.
2016-02-13:
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: Adds a space-worthy exploration suit only for greys. Sprites courtesy
      of Niggly.
  - rscadd: Adds vox, plasmaman, and grey spacesuit crates to cargo, so plasmamen
      hit by polyacid can finally get a replacement helmet and such.
  xpcybic:
  - wip: The following changes apply to Taxistation.
  - tweak: Redesigned almost all of medbay with the goal of reducing cramp and improving
      workflow between departments. Adds a lobby, moves sleepers/cryo to center, moves
      paramedic to left, moves patient rooms to upper-left, adds a medical storage
      room, enlarges genetics, virology, and CMO.
  - tweak: Changed morgue airlock to require either morgue or paramedic access.
  - tweak: Expanded the small room in medsci maint into an unfinished office.
  - bugfix: Fixed vent and scrubber piping in CE office.
  - rscadd: Added intercom to AI upload.
  - rscadd: Added missing NT Default and Robocop lawsets to AI upload.

  - bugfix: Fixed an incorrect airlock on the emergency shuttle.
  - rscadd: Fixed a severe lack of supplies on the syndicate shuttle.
  - bugfix: Fixed a docking port being too close to engi/cargo, preventing the syndicate
      shuttle from docking at it.
  - tweak: Adjusted derelict arrivals so that the salvage shuttle can dock at it.
2016-02-14:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed a very bizzare bug that could result in humans (especially lings,
      monkeymen, and head transplanted players) having TWO different blood types,
      each one of them only used for certain things.
  - bugfix: Monkeymen will now properly have randomized blood types.
  - rscdel: Players will now have randomized blood types as well. Random blood types
      follow a weighted distribution. Hopefully this will save Medbay from a lot of
      headaches.
  - experiment: 'The blood type distribution is as follows: 36% O+, 28% A+, 20% B+,
      5% AB+, 4% O-, 3% A-, 1% B-, 1% AB-. This is the same distribution Monkeymen
      were supposed to have, although a bug prevented it from working properly.'
  - rscadd: Your blood type is now added to your character notes when you spawn, in
      case you lose your ID (use the 'notes' verb, IC tab). You can check on other
      people's blood type by examining their ID or using the Medical Records database.
  - rscadd: Added a 'Wake-Up Cycle' option to Sleepers, which will try to wake up
      the occupant. This is intended to work as an alternative to the Mancrowave.
      Alt-clicking a Sleeper while an occupant is inside will automatically start
      this cycle.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Paralysis Summary timer not working properly on Sleepers (this
      will give you an approximation of how long the occupant's paralysis/sleep would
      last if left alone).
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Added the blunderbuss.
  - rscadd: Added the tomahawk.
  - rscadd: Added the pipe tomahawk.
  - rscadd: Added the cannon.
  - rscadd: Added the railgun.
  - rscadd: Added the sword.
  - rscadd: Added the executioner's sword.
  - rscadd: Added the venom sword.
  - rscadd: Added the Hivehand.
  - rscadd: Added the revialver.
  - rscadd: Added the blast cannon.
  - rscadd: Added the subspace tunneler.
  - soundadd: Added a cylinder spin sound for the russian revolver.
  - tweak: The chance of a limb being severed by a sharp weapon now scales with the
      weapon's sharpness.
  - rscadd: Added Anchor Arms.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Wizards now spawn with all organic limbs and internal organs.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added a new, disorienting hallucination effect.
2016-02-15:
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Baby carps now attack unconscious mobs. When they attack living mobs enough
      times, they grow up.
  - rscadd: Baby carps can be fed by attacking them with meat. Feeding them has a
      slight chance of making them your friend, and will eventually cause them to
      grow up.
  - rscadd: Baby animals now consider their mother's friends their friends. This applies
      to space carps, too
2016-02-16:
  JoeMother0:
  - imageadd: The Gumshoe detective alt title now starts with his own original suit
      and coat
2016-02-17:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Cryo cells now pop you out at a safe temperature once again, though just
      cold enough to give you the jitters for a few seconds. However, it takes 4 seconds
      to eject somebody from a Cryo cell. Essentially, the Mancrowave's body heat
      regulation functionality was directly implemented into Cryo.
  - rscadd: Cryo cells now also give a short period of grace to non-oxygen-breathing
      races after being ejected from Cryo, in which they won't breathe (and Plasmamen
      won't combust) so that they may be given internals safely. This is to replace
      the effects of post-cryo Hypothermia, which made people not breathe.
2016-02-19:
  CptWad:
  - rscadd: PBJ's code that makes it so now supermatters not on your z-level exploding
      will have no effect on your z-level.

  - bugfix: Turned that one vent at arrivals on that should have been on in the first
      place.
  - bugfix: Repaired the pipes at cryo.
  - bugfix: The lightswitch in atmospherics is now reachable.
  - tweak: Moved the Phalanximine out of the CMO's office. You can still find it however.
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: The following changes are to Defficiency
  - rscadd: Ported over metaclubs Centcomm, so ERT and Deathsquad can exist and more
      room for bus
  - rscadd: Added the Vox Skipjack from box, so now Vox Raiders can happen on Defficiency
  - rscadd: Added the salvage shuttle to Z level 6, but as Defficiency is defficient
      of an aux-docking port, it cant dock to the station properly.
  - rscadd: Fixed a piping error in xenobiology, gave it and the research corridor
      some more vents considering the size
  - rscadd: Expanded the xenobotany area on the research outpost. It now also has
      gas-controlled trays (just need to wrench them down)
  - rscadd: Added an autolathe to R&D
  - rscadd: Fixed a few area mishaps (Area in front of the HoPs office that had no
      defined area, areas in the SME room that werent correct)
  - rscadd: Relocated the Mancrowave in medical to somewhere a bit more sensible,
      removed the Sec outpost from medical as it was unused.
  - rscadd: Removed stools from the brig as they no longer counted as chairs, but
      weapons.
  - rscadd: Added a vox outpost to the asteroid z-level, a bit off the beaten track
  SonixApache:
  - imageadd: Ian now wears his engineering RIG properly. He can also wear security
      vests and a SWAT helmet.
  Sood:
  - experiment: 'Deus Ex Update:'
  - tweak: (Deus Ex Update hijacked by Sood from N3X15)
  - rscadd: Lungs are now fully modular and actually process gas for humans.  Lungs
      must be compatible with a species or they will die of suffocation.
  - rscadd: Vox and Plasmamen have their own lungs.
  - rscadd: Most species currently exhale CO<sub>2</sub>.  Vox may be tweaked later
      to exhale N<sub>2</sub>O. Plasmamen exhale oxygen, though.
  - rscadd: Robotics can make Advanced Lungs (programming 2, biomech 4), which are
      compatible with all species and filter out some gasses (N2O and plasma), up
      to certain partial pressures.
  - rscadd: Livers are also modular and can be set to enhance "natural" removal rates
      of reagents. Nothing yet makes any use of this, so all livers are standard UNTIL
      YOU CODE IT.
  - rscadd: Livers which are bruised will deal toxin damage to their owner if the
      user has any toxic reagents in their system. Ethanol with a bruised liver is
      extremely dangerous.
  - rscadd: Livers become damaged over time if their owner has a lot of toxin damage.
      Doctors beware.
  - rscadd: Eyes are modular and Advanced Type 1 eyes can grant enhanced nightvision
      and built-in welder goggles.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added cages. Mobs inside cages can interact with the outside world, unless
      the cage's cover is closed. Alt-clicking a cage will toggle its cover. Cages
      with closed covers can be used to safely transport hostile animals (or assistants).
  - rscadd: Cages can be crafted with 6 plasteel sheets.
2016-02-22:
  Sood:
  - bugfix: Plasmen now react to oxygen and actually need plasma to breathe again.
      Blame N3X for everything it's fine :^)
  Unid:
  - bugfix: Fixed some bugs with cages. Cyborgs can now interact with cages.
  - tweak: Cages can now be quickly opened with some weapons or tools.
  - soundadd: Cages make a sound when opened or closed
2016-02-23:
  TheEliminator16:
  - tweak: Made autocloner spawn things faster in general
  - tweak: Added skrite and necromorph as possibilities for autocloner
  - imageadd: Made autocloner animated like it always should have been
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Cameras can take both 1x1 and 3x3 photos. Use the new Set Camera Zoom
      verb (or alt-click) to switch between the modes.
  - bugfix: Fixed being unable to take photos of yourself. Fixed AIs being unable
      to photograph mobs.
  - wip: Added admin-spawnable cameras that take 5x5 and 7x7 photos. They are experimental
      and may lag.
2016-02-24:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: 'Fixed electric chairs not working. To prevent confusion, electric chairs
      now start on. To use an electric chair: Screwdriver on electropack, apply helmet,
      use on chair. Activate the electric chair with a remote signaler tuned to the
      electropack''s frequency and code.'
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added boomerangs - heavy throwing weapons that can be crafted from wooden
      planks. When thrown, they fly in an arc around the target and return to your
      hands.
  - tweak: Animal attacks can now be blocked by shields and reactive teleport armour
  - bugfix: Fixed boomerangs spinning forever. Fixed boomerangs doing only a fraction
      of their actual damage on impact
  - bugfix: Fixed some bugs with hostile animals being stored in cages
  Zth:
  - rscadd: SCP-294 added.

  Icantthinkofanameritenow:
  - tweak: Replaced advanced energy guns in the protolathe with a modkit that converts
      regular energy guns into AEGs.
