      a human, a fat human, a monkey, or a vox.

  - bugfix: This also fixes a bug where power cell damage can't be fixed (because
      of a stupid loop). You still have to place a new power cell though.

      by a bolt of animation. Additionally, I've added a few variables that allow
      mappers to create mannequins that automatically awaken when they spawn, or when
      a mob walks next to them, or when you try to strip them, and that make nearby
      mannequins awaken as well. Destroying a Living Mannequin drop their items. If
      the mannequin was holding a highly damaging item when it woke up, it'll fight
