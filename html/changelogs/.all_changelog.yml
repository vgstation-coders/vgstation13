2021-01-02:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Cultists no longer auto-shade on Act 1+ when beheaded.
  - tweak: Cultists that have been decapitated/de-brained can now choose to shade
      when using the Ghost verb.
  - tweak: However whether they try to shade while still in their body or after they've
      been decapitated/debrained/mmi'd, they can only do so up to 60 seconds after
      the time of death. (living cultists can still shade out anytime they want of
      course)
  - tweak: Shades now take 1hp of damage per Life() tick while in space, killing them
      in about one or two minutes. So no more sitting in space breaking windows.
  - tweak: Shades also now take damage and get slowed by holy water just like constructs
      do.
  IThe-TI:
  - rscadd: Added eggnog
  - bugfix: Fixes missing pear tree sprite
  Kharkov72:
  - tweak: Firefighters (An offshoot of ripleys) now have the same brute resist as
      ripleys
  - rscadd: Various snaxi tweaks/bugfixes, Pun Pun is now a penguin.
  - rscadd: Roboticists now start with full toolbelts.
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: Snaxi brig now has a private snowmobile storage/impound yard. The keys
      spawn in a locker.
  - rscadd: Snaxi now hosts the new snow gear vendors. A number of other small quality
      of life changes as well.
  - tweak: Blizzards should be shorter on average.
  - rscdel: Dark Season / Omega Blizzard is now adminbus only.
  - tweak: When slicing a door open with an esword (harm intent), it now dismantles
      the door like a ram.
  - rscadd: Players may now use the "Get unique job" preference. This means it will
      not assign you to any job where someone else shares the same job slot. For example,
      if you high-pref botanist and there is already a botanist, it will try your
      medium preferences. If none of your preferences are empty, you will return to
      the lobby.
  - rscadd: Trees (such as those on Snaxi) become transparent when you are within
      2 tiles
  - rscadd: The labor console can now close extra slots if they have not been filled
      yet.
  - rscadd: You can now build fireplaces out of bricks.
  - rscadd: There is now a snow gear vendor. Gear up to settle the snow, or just pick
      your favorite color scarf. It even has contraband and premium items...
  - rscadd: You can now build log walls by using a log on the snowy ground. It will
      try to use any logs on the ground before the one in your hand. It builds twice
      as fast if you clear the snow first.
  - tweak: When you build a new turf on unsimulated terrain, it will keep the same
      air mix, preventing ZAS while building.
  - rscadd: You can use one log on another to construct a storm door. Storm doors
      are wood doors that shut by themselves fairly quickly, keeping out the cold.
  - tweak: Pine logs are now worth 4 planks of wood, instead of just 2.
  - tweak: Asphalt roads now protect wires and pipes from being destroyed by explosions.
  - bugfix: Geysers now properly smoke (vents do not smoke) and heat you up based
      on your proximity to the geyser. Unstable geysers can burn you fairly easily,
      so be careful!
  - rscadd: Geysers can now melt nearby snow in a circle. Unstable geysers do it the
      fastest - melted snow? take it slow!
  - rscadd: You can shovel a geyser to fill it in and reduce the rate it puts out
      heat. Do it enough and you can seal it completely. Shovel a sealed geyser to
      completely remove it.
  - rscadd: Geysers hit by explosions can get sealed, but unstable geysers could go
      critical and spew out extreme heat. Call a suited atmospheric technician to
      seal it if this happens. Do not be tempted to build a thermoelectric generator
      around the critical geyser.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where geysers wouldn't transfer heat to simulated turfs.
  SonixApache:
  - tweak: 'Detomatix: Rather than blowing YOU up, failing a chance roll now outs
      you with a PDA message.'
  - tweak: 'Detomatix: Trying to blow up a fellow syndie still fails, but sends them
      a code word and shows you a code response instead of a blank error.'

      to deal with.

      low chances

  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where everyone shoeless who kicks Vox would be treated as
      having talons.
  PrimeDSS13:
  - rscadd: When you have all your teeth removed, you "gum" people instead of just
      automatically switching to punch.
  - tweak: Vampires now get a message saying "You cannot suck blood with no teeth"
      Instead of punching their victims.
  beesil:
  - rscadd: Adds ancient cryopods that polls ghosts to become the occupant of a pod
      frozen in time. Able to be acquired through a vault, random event, and xenoarchaeology.

2021-01-07:
  Kharkov72:
  - tweak: Small roid fixes.
  - rscadd: The Supermatter Cascade portal now actually says where it is vaguely,
      instead of just blanket giving "Research Outpost"
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - rscdel: Entities that aren't possessed by a player will no longer count towards
      the station's infected members score, previously it was used in an exploit to
      make the station's score incredibly low, which would allow Lamprey to be selected
  gurfan:
  - tweak: Halves wizard chances.
2021-01-08:

  PJB3005:
  - tweak: Xenoarch analysis machines do not require cooling anymore.
  - tweak: Box (and meta) outpost has been reworked significantly to merge the chemistry
      and anomaly lab, changing xenobotany and the dorms in the process. Also has

  Kurfursten:

      machines, and a protolathe window.

      you join.

      Galatic-Common`" (or any language name) to speak it as your default. You can
      use the space key to autocomplete the name of the language. Using "Set-Default-Language"
      with no parameter will revert your currently spoken language to the default
      for your species.
2021-01-20:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: New antag role! "Syndicate Challengers". Roughly based on the old
      double-agents game mode. Remember to update your preferences to try it out.
  - rscadd: Challengers are fairly similar to traitors in that they have an uplink,
      some TCs, even code words, however their single objective is to assassinate
      another challenger aboard the station, henceforth there's always at least 2
      of them tasked with killing each others. When there are more than 2 challengers,
      their assassination orders are chained so that the first one hunts the second
      one, the second one hunts the third one, etc, until the last one who hunts the
      first one. Once an assassination has been successfully carried out and reported
      to the Syndicate, you take on your victim's target (unless it was you in which
      case no more objectives are given) and receive 5 additional TCs.
  - rscadd: For a successful assassination to be permanently secured by the Syndicate,
      you must take a photo of your victim's dead (crit is enough) body, severed head,
      or brain, and publish it on any newscaster channel for all the crew to see their
      dead body. You can use any channel, but you may want to use your victim's ID
      to create one so as to keep the crew guessing as to your identity, or send the
      message with another stolen ID to send security on a red herring.
  - experiment: This variant on traitor puts the emphasis on robustness and direct
      confrontation between traitors, but the Syndicate doesn't care how the deed
      is performed so long as the kill is reported. Once it has, your victim's own
      assassination objective is forever marked as failed even if they get revived
      and their target dies later.
  - experiment: Cult conversions have been reworked! Details below.
  - experiment: The sounds produced by conversion runes can now only be heard by those
      who have a line of sight to the rune.
  - experiment: Automatic boxing now only happens to cult-banned players.
  - experiment: Refusing conversion now restrains you with ghastly bindings that hinders
      your movements through pain. It takes 1 minute to resist out of those.
  - experiment: Loyalty Implants no longer slow down conversions, but instead force-refuse
      them.
  - rscdel: Setting your cult preferences to Never no longer auto-refuses conversions
      (you now always get the choice) but still displays your preferences as such
      to Seer users.
  - rscadd: Non-cultists restrained by ghastly bindings show up on the altar's cult
      roster, and are valid Blood Magnetism targets (for both summoning and rejoining)
  - rscadd: The pain induced by ghastly bindings fades over time, but gets reset when
      their victim travels through the veil (Path or Blood Magnetism runes)
  - rscadd: The cultist who performed the conversion that restrained someone will
      instantly be informed should the bindings get removed. The bindings also remove
      themselves should another conversion attempt succeed.
  - tweak: Cultists no longer resist Loyalty Implanters, instead the implant pops
      out 10 seconds later.
  - tweak: All loyalty implanted cultists also get informed that they have 10 seconds
      before their implant pops out when Act 2 begins.
  - rscadd: Added holy implants. Can be ordered at cargo. Implanted cultists become
      unable to perform any ritual or use any cult spells. They also become unable
      to travel through the veil (Path Runes or Blood Magnetism) or be affected by
      Fervor. However they are destroyed upon conversion so they cannot be used preemptively
      unlike loyalty implants.
  - tweak: Cultists with holy water in their body will also suffer from those impediments.
  - experiment: Cult deconversions are a thing once again 2 years and a half later.
      They work as such, first have the cultist (or suspected cultist) take a sip
      of holy water (splashing them from the flask also works, or giving them a holy
      wafer to eat, etc). Immediately after slap them with a bible on help intent
      (the target needs to have over 20hp or it won't work). Everyone can do it, not
      just chaplains. If the target wasn't a cultist, nothing unusual happens. Otherwise
      they will be knockdown and given the choice to abandon the cult or resist. In
      both cases after 10 seconds, they take 10 brute damage, and a pair of red shades
      appear. If they accepted the deconversion, those shades will immediately start
      attacking them, otherwise if they resisted the shades will attack the one who
      attempted the deconversion, and other nearby non-cultists.
  - experiment: If a chaplain performed the deconversion with a bible of their religion,
      those red shades have 20hp and deal 5 damage, making them about as much of an
      inconvenience as blob spores. Otherwise they will be as strong as regular shades.
  - rscadd: Bibles, Holy Water, Incense, and Thuribles are now available from Cargo
      as Religious Paraphernelia under Supplies.
  - tweak: Cult mobs spawned by bloodstones no longer stand still for a while before
      attacking non-cultists, they instead immediately give chase once they spawn.
  - tweak: Blood Communion tattoo now also gives a small buff to blood regen.
  - bugfix: Fixed Confusion runes sometimes causing people to remain blinded forever
      when they time-out.
  - bugfix: Fixed deculted players still having cult UI elements on their screen
  - bugfix: Fixed splashing mobs with a holy water flask applying the equivalent of
      half the flask's current volume to them instead of only the 5u being spent.
  - bugfix: Fixed the holy water flask having wrong in-hand sprites when facing some
      directions.
  - bugfix: Using a soulstone on a cultist shade as a non-cultist now properly decults
      the shade.
  - rscadd: De-culted players now get a message specifying exactly what they remember
      about the cult, generally only the player who converted them.
  - rscadd: Cultists can now use altars as operating tables with the same efficiency
      as if they were using an actual operating table. Furthermore, Blood Daggers
      can now be used as ghetto scalpels and circular saws, and Talismans can be used
      as ghetto hemostats.
  HarseTheef:
  - rscadd: Adds the changeling vial, stone mask, and the cult pamphlet to the traitor
      uplink for traitors that want to work together.
  - tweak: Cyborg examine text upon death is more useful
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: The science department has developed a new weather control device to deploy
      on Snaxi.
  - rscadd: Fatsos can now wear the default wintercoat, as well as the security and
      warden versions.
  - bugfix: Hard rock walls on Snaxi are now less pointy
  - tweak: Snaxi brig has been overhauled. It's less chokepointy.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where random bloodstones could sometimes spawn off station
      randomly as long as it was still on Z-1 (for example, in the caves on Snaxi
      or in the Vox outpost on Roid)
  - rscadd: There are now vaults to discover on the Snaxi outer reaches.
  - rscdel: Converted the old Santa cabin and construction site on Snaxi into random
      vaults.
  - tweak: Wolves won't lose nutrition until tamed, and tamed wolves will lose nutrition
      much slower.
  - rscadd: Feral wolves will always attack, whereas pliable wolves are much easier
      to tame.
  PlausibleDeniability:
  - rscadd: The HoS has a new outfit in their closet
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: Banana peels are now more slippery, meaning you can slide a few tiles forward
      if you walk into one.
  - tweak: Cultists now unlock the Forge at Act 1. Additionally, they may now use
      spells which were previously limited to Act 2 and 3.

  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - rscadd: Banana peels now slip you further based on potency
2021-01-24:
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: The tradervend now has access to several lootboxes, sponsored by EA. It's
      in the game.
2021-01-25:
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: Barrels no longer have a delay transferring reagents
2021-01-26:
  Allspice:
  - tweak: Traitor cleaver knockdown-on-throw chance 85% -> 100%

      and vox

      their uplink.

      wiki page) in their backpack. The guide also reacts with snow to flash-ignite
      for a quick boost of heat.
2021-01-30:
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: Syndicate agents now have a tesla cannon available in their uplink.
2021-01-31:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Soulstone Shards can now be used to perform surgery as efficiently as
      glass shards.
  - bugfix: Fixed lasers bouncing off mobs when they should instead miss them (and
      the chat message properly appears once again)
  - bugfix: Fixed lasers no longer going through portals.
  - bugfix: Nuke Ops rejoice! Fixed clicking directly on a portal or teleporter hub
      with a ranged weapon causing the projectile to hit the portal instead of properly
      going through it. This should finally spell an end to nuke ops accidentally
      blowing themselves up trying to fire their RPG through their teleporter.
  - bugfix: Fixed an oversight that let cyborgs spawn as Syndicate Challengers.
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: When you build a snowman, it's just an inanimate structure (clearable with
      a single shovel). If you can give it a carrot nose and a magical hat, however,
      it will spring to life and give you gifts (gifts only first time that hat is
      used).
  ShiftyRail:
  - rscadd: Added tag mode! Changeling clown in a station of Mimes! More info on the
      wiki!

2021-02-01:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: The Gravity artifact effect now has a one second cooldown if activated
      through touch to prevent server-crashing infinite loops. Also this has technically
      been a feature since 2016, interesting it took this long to cause a crash.
  - tweak: When using a bible on someone with holy water in them, you and your target
      now have to stay still for 5 seconds before the ritual proceeds. Cultists get
      a big message in red warning them that someone is trying to deconvert them.
  - tweak: Non-chaplains performing deconversion will only knockdown cultists for
      half the duration.
  - tweak: Cultists with the Unholy Protection tattoo will be immune to the knockdown
      altogether.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Capitalised the first letter on "Ectoplasm" and "Diabeetusol" so they
      match the naming scheme (first letter uppercase)
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - rscadd: 'Roid: Added a substation next to the zoo and a few more AME parts so
      the station gets over the bump of power issues at roundstart.'
  Kromkar:
  - rscadd: Tweaks Black Site Prism; minor mapping changes, rebalances loot and adds
      Syndicate Exec mob. Changes Commandant Chuck Sneed to Buck Reed.
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: A few map fixes on Snaxi and its vaults.
  - bugfix: Capybaras have fixed movement.
  MintyEtude:
  - imageadd: Nanotrasen has spent an inordinate amount of money on new ore processing
      console screensavers so that the mining department can't file any abandonment
      complaints.
  SonixApache:
  - rscadd: Implanters and implant cases now tell you what implant is loaded in them
      upon examination.
  - rscadd: Implants now work properly when surgically implanted into people.
  - rscadd: Surgically removed implants can be put back into implant cases to make
      them implanter-compatible again.
  - rscdel: (syndicate) Implants now have a (high) chance to fizzle out upon removal.
  - bugfix: Implants no longer work when broken.
2021-02-03:
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - bugfix: Roidsubstation now requires engineering access.
  - tweak: Increased the size of packed mechanics office slightly.
  - bugfix: We found the missing SMES for packed Engineering. We predict this will
      reduce new engineers singuloosing on packed by 12:30 by 47.65%. Also changed
      some firelocks and wires to be more intuitive/easier to navigate and repair.
  Kurfursten:
  - bugfix: The armory is now on the proper power grid on Snaxi
  SonixApache:
  - imageadd: Changed armor vest sprites up a bit. For those who prefer the fat straps,
      use an armor vest on a secvend.
2021-02-04:
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - bugfix: Shame. Missing terminals.
  Sooose:
  - bugfix: Removed the ability to throw anvils with telekinesis.
2021-02-05:
  Exxion:

      their direction again when moved instead of turning to face the direction of
      movement.'
  PJB3005:
  - bugfix: deadharvest artifact effect won't randomly break and correctly gets copied
      to artifact batteries.
  - bugfix: Admin rejuvenate no longer bulldozes various mutations like no breathing.
2021-02-06:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: The Pay2Use Large Artifact effect trigger can now only appear in a Primary
      Effect, never a Secondary Effect (because paying money is annoying enough that
      you shouldn't on top of that have only a 25% chance for it to activate the effect)
  - tweak: Large Artifacts featuring a Pay2Use primary effect trigger can now be summarily
      examined to see if they appear to feature a coin slot, bill acceptor, or card
      reader, since the Anomaly Analysis will otherwise give you the same results
      as a Touch or Reagent trigger, and such features should be noticeable to the
      naked eye anyway.
2021-02-07:
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Mimes now also know the Clown language, as per that whole "Clown-Mime
      War" thing.

      (Light Pink).'
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - tweak: Advanced Camera Consoles on all maps have been changed for regular Camera
      Consoles, with a board left behind in the warden's locker as an afterthought
      by the repo-man who downgraded them.
  Kharkov72:
  - imageadd: new bar sign, the hungry bug.
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: The shrunken vampire head can now be used inhand once per minute to screech
      and break glass within 1 tile. Unlike a real screech, this does not stun anyone.
  - tweak: The shrunken vampire head flash now pierces eye protection like vampire
      glare. It also has 7 force instead of 0.
  - tweak: The depocket wand is now small enough to fit in pockets.
  - tweak: The energy shotgun now indicates how to toggle its fire mode when examined
      (alt-click).
  - tweak: The autocuffer can now be used on orange shoes.
  - tweak: 'Removing cuffs from shoes now executes their removal effect (e.g.: explodes
      syndicuffs, deletes borg cuffs)'
  - rscadd: Traders are now selling a ricochet taser.
  PJB3005:
  - tweak: Xenoarch triangulation has no more maximum distance to find artifacts.
      Alden-Saraspovas still do like before. The idea here is that triangulation can
      now be used as a late-game tool if you're having trouble locating further artifacts
      with Saraspovas.
  - rscadd: Admin rejuvenate now re-attaches butts.
  - tweak: Vox and plasmamen can now safely use the xenoarchaeology essence printer.
  PrimeDSS13:
  - tweak: roomba stab cooldown is now five seconds as opposed to ten
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - rscadd: Added a new medical robot board that upgrades its surgery tools.
2021-02-08:
  MintyEtude:
  - imageadd: Some old bar signs [Saucy Clown, Clown's Head, The Damn Wall, Limbo]
      have been refurbished with shiny new neon tubing. Take a look around your local
      establishment next time the rest of the crew gets stone drunk off whiskey and
      starts blasting ancient showtunes throughout the station.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where you could literally not build cyborgs on Castlestation.
      Yes, this is a bug, this is not a feature, this is an unintended gameplay element
      that has been unfortunately cut out of the final product. You may now jeer as
      the only thing that kept security cyborgs on Castle at bay(station) was this
      bug, which is now gone, and now so is the fun.
2021-02-10:
  Kharkov72:
  - tweak: Janitors can use the door to disposals from the cargo lobby now.
  - bugfix: Amish suits on the floor should exist again.

2021-02-11:
  Allspice:
  - tweak: Let wraiths use their jaunt spell by pressing the "use inhand item" button.
  beesil:
  - tweak: Changes threshold for flavor text to show a "more" button from 32 characters
      -> 64 characters.
2021-02-12:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Empty Soul Gems can now be fitted into a Construct Shell, turning it into
      a Shade Beacon. Roaming shades can use the beacon to become a construct without
      the need for another player to slot them inside the shell, allowing cultists
      to prepare those in preparation of a fight (because once Act 3 hits no cultist
      has time to make you a soul gem or a shell, let alone deal with you).
  - rscadd: Artificers can now slot Soul Gems (empty or full) in a construct shell
      if both are adjacent to them, by just clicking on the shell. You can also click
      the beacon to get the empty gem back.
  - tweak: Artificer health buffed from 50hp to 100hp. They're now a bit more sturdy
      than Wraiths (that only have 75hp) but still far from Juggernauts (250hp). This
      should help them survive more than two seconds once their base is getting broken
      into, they still suck in direct combat though.
  - rscdel: Wraiths can no longer fire bolts that nail mobs down in place.
  - rscadd: This nailing ability has been moved to thrown blood daggers.
  - rscadd: Wraith Phase Shift cooldown from 17 seconds to 15 seconds.
  - rscadd: Wraiths have a new Wraith Tear spell (with 7.5 seconds cooldown) that
      essentially gives them warping claws ability. Just like with warping claws you
      can channel the ability by toggling throw mode. The portals created by Wraith
      Tear only last 3 seconds and do not connect atmospheres, nor create sparks when
      they close. Non-cultist carbons who pass through them will experience 3 seconds
      of cult confusion, along with dizziness and other misc. effects. Lastly those
      portals leave a blood splatter behind them.
  - rscadd: Wraiths have now learned to write two runes specifically, Path Entrance
      and Path Exit. Each with a 60 seconds cooldown.
  - tweak: Wraiths damage has been nerfed from 25 brute to 15 brute.
  - experiment: The intent is to have Wraith perform more of a support role directly
      on the field, unlike Artificers that generally stay in base or Juggernauts that
      go straight into fights. By having two movement spells Wraiths can more easily
      get out of danger (they have the lowest HP of all constructs now) While the
      ability to write down Path Runes makes them a valuable asset to the cult beyond
      getting rid of a nosy AI.
  - imageadd: Wraiths also have a new Phase Shift animation.
  - bugfix: Fixed thrown blood daggers appearing with an incorrect sprite when created
      using non-red blood.
  Sooose:
  - bugfix: All heads of staff can now fax Nanotrasen HR to demote or commend employees.
  coldud13:
  - bugfix: Snaxi gateway room now accepts either teleporter or gateway access.

2021-02-16:

  - tweak: People with morgue access can now no longer use the morgue interior door
      as a shortcut to sneak into medbay.
  - rscdel: Security checkpoint on deff has door into medbay removed to keep in line
      with the new policy.
2021-02-21:
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: the Juggernaut construct's shield that protects it from weapons of force
      10 and below now also protects it from similarly weak thrown items, punches,
      and projectiles.
  - tweak: HOWEVER its armor goes away completely when it loses a third of its health
      (and cracks begin to appear, as explained below). The armor comes back when
      the juggernaut is healed past the threshold by an artificer.
  - imageadd: A visual cue and sound appear whenever an attack gets successfully blocked
      by a juggernaut's shield
  - imageadd: Constructs now have luminous cracks visibly appear on their shell as
      they take damage. They have two different cracked states, each reached after
      losing another third of their health. (and of course getting healed by an artificer
      will remove those cracks)
  - imageadd: Slightly improved the ectoplasm sprite, so it looks both better on the
      floor, and is easier to click.
  - imageadd: Ectoplasm spawned from shattered constructs will now be of the same
      color as the eyes of the construct it came from.
  - bugfix: The ghosts of dead constructs or shades no longer appear like grey piles
      of dust.
  toomykins:
  - rscadd: added "get belt" verb
2021-02-22:
  Allspice:
  - tweak: Also let juggers and artis use one of their spells by clicking the "activate
      held object" button.

  - rscdel: Removed Solanine from Amborsia Vulgaris

      Syndie Bundle option
  ShiftyRail:
  - rscadd: During Blood Cult, one cultist is the chief of the Cult and can talks
      directly to other cultists by using ":x". He gets also a special HuD icon.
2021-03-02:
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: Jukeboxes, transmitters, and uranium tiles/walls/doors now provide power
      to radiation collectors. Jukebox engine patent pending.

  - rscadd: Body scanners can now be emagged to irradiate their occupant.
  - rscadd: Sleepers can now be emagged to disable overdose protection and give fake
      readouts if a patient is being overdosed.
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: New items added to the merch computer. Including a cheap soap guaranteed
      for 20 uses (and then has a progressively increasing chance of melting away),
      and Sterile Masks, that come in the usual medbay variety along with a more sober
      black variant, and a terribly clowny colorful variant.
  - rscadd: Sterile Masks can now be moved away from your face like breath masks can.
      Doing so will null their sterility factor until you put it back on properly.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Lossetta stone now can teach Clownish as well.
  - rscadd: Holy water works the same as water when mixed with potassium.
  - rscadd: Holy water-potassium explosions play a HALLELUJAH sound effect.
  - rscadd: Holy water-Potassium explosions are slightly stronger than regular water-potassium
      explosions.
  N3X15:
  - rscadd: Added a bunch of new words to VOX announcements.
  PavelCIA:
  - rscadd: Adds the "Impostor" character from the 2018 hit video game "Among Us"

      with them.

  - bugfix: Diona nymphs wearing bags of holding now properly create singularities
      if put inside another bag of holding.

  - rscadd: Adds in wolf headdress, just skin a wolf and you can have your very own
      wolf headdress!
  - rscadd: Wolves now have teeth to be removed
2021-03-09:
  boy2mantwicethefam:

      magics that mess with the fabric of reality are unaffected.
  - tweak: The MK2 medical cyborg upgrade now also doubles the storage capacity for
      brute kits, burn kits and splinters.
2021-03-11:
  Apogee-dev:
  - tweak: Lightswitches are now turned off by default.
  - tweak: Lightswitches check for players at roundstart and turn on if there are
      any present.
  DeityLink:
  - soundadd: Added a Funk playlist to the jukebox, courtesy of Dickwrath.
  - soundadd: Added a brand new Shoegaze playlist to the jukebox. With lots of reverb
      for that big old bar feel.
  - imageadd: Revamped the vinyl sprite. The label in the center is still red by default
      but can be customized for each different playlist.
  - experiment: Player-controlled Giant Spiders now have some sort of color-matrix
      powered night vision that lets them see quite well in the dark while still being
      able to identify lit areas, and therefore to seek lights to destroy. Might refine
      later. Feedback welcome.
  - rscadd: Player-controlled Giant Spiders have a brand new HUD, featuring a health
      indicator, a fire warning, and a zone selection (for choosing which limb to
      target on humans). Spiderlings also have an indicator for their growth, while
      Nurse have indicators for both how many eggs they can lay, and how many spiders
      there are in total, as well as how many are needed before they can evolve into
      a Queen.
  - rscadd: Player-controlled spiderlings are now able to ventcrawl (turns out they
      couldn't until now, despite NPC spiderlings being one of the only mob actually
      having an AI that lets it ventcrawl)
  - rscadd: Player-controlled Giant Spiders now have spells for all their abilities
      that can be cast by players should they end up controlling one. This includes
      Spiderlings growing up (they get to choose whether to become Guard, Nurse or
      Hunter), as well as Nurse spinning webs, cocoons, laying eggs, and evolving
      into queens
  - tweak: Spider hunters are now twice faster, still slower than carps though.
  - rscadd: Changed the requirements and logic behind spider nurses evolving into
      queens. Before nurses would instantly become queens if there were less than
      5 queens in the world. Now there has to be at least 10 spiders total (including
      spiderlings) per queen in the world for an NPC nurse to evolve. It will then
      have a 10% chance per second to evolve. Player-controlled nurses only require
      6 spiders per queen, ensuring that NPC nurses shouldn't cuck players out of
      becoming queens. As a side-effect, non-queen nurses will become more common
      once again.
  - rscadd: Spider queen projectiles no longer deal 5 brute damage, instead they root
      mobs to the floor just like blood nails do. As for those, resisting or clicking
      the webs will let you break out after one or two seconds. The queen can fire
      her projectile about every three or four seconds at best (BYOND time is uncertain).
  - bugfix: Fixed the giant spider queen's projectile being invisible
  - bugfix: Fixed NPC spider nurses laying two egg clusters when they should only
      be able to lay one, causing them to birth twice as many spiderlings as normal.
  plosky1:
  - rscadd: Lowfat Bagel is now available. I hope you all lose some weight from it.
2021-03-13:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Syndicate code words not being highlighted in red for challengers.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Clean SE Centcomm Order from being impossible to complete.
  - bugfix: Through the magic of icon operations, not only are Medibots once again
      of the color of the first-aid kit used to build them, but this time ALL first-aid
      kit variants are supported, as the bot's icon is generated from the kit's icon.
  - tweak: Medibots no longer give different reagent depending on the first-aid kit
      used to build them, instead they now all give the "better" reagent corresponding
      to the damage type instead of tricord.
2021-03-14:

  - rscadd: You can now solidify Banana Juice to Bananium Sheets, using 20u Silicate,

  - rscadd: You can now set a custom output tile for Cryo and Cloners by using a multitool,
      similar to how it works for autolathes and other fabricators. When automatically
      ejecting patients, they will go to the custom tile instead of on top of the
      machine.
  kane-f:
  - tweak: Prisoner management consoles no longer file remote explosive implants under
      their own header

  - bugfix: Fixed the Rocket-Dash mecha spell icon being blank
  - tweak: The Exosuit-Mounted Teleporter is now precise. Previously it had a 4-tile
      precision radius, meaning you could land anywhere in one of the 81 tiles (in
      a 9x9 area) surrounding the tile you clicked, which made it utterly unreliable
      on top of having a long cooldown. Often you'd even teleport right where you
      started from.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: RTGs and PDTGs malfunction if they get EMP'd or Ion'd, possibly losing
      max charge, self-charging speed or both.

  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed shades missing their Cult HUD when re-login into the game.
  - bugfix: Fixed Pipe Caps not properly connecting to pipes or being of the wrong
      color when painted. Not that they actually do anything beyond being cosmetic.
  - rscadd: Added Heat Exchanger Pipe Caps. Still cosmetic, still useless, those connect
      to Heat Exchanger Pipes. Use them if you want your pipes to look neat I guess.
  - imageadd: Fixed a few pipe sprites, namely Heat Exchanger Junctions have a new
      sprite as an item.
  - tweak: Re-arranged some of Boxstation's TEG setup. Removed some useless and redundant
      connectors, and swapped the CO2 canisters with some of the Plasma canisters
      from Engineering storage, so newbies don't get under the impression that CO2
      is meant to be the better choice for those gas loops. (A long time ago those
      were there to help stop fires that'd come out from the burn chamber but CO2
      clearly doesn't do anything in case of fire anymore)
  - tweak: Moved a bit the Blast Doors on Packedstation's TEG burn chamber so they
      are in view from the computers.
  - rscadd: If a Nuclear Operative spawns with some active gene, such as near-sightedness
      or fatness because of character setup, they will now receive a ryetalyn pill
      in their pocket to offer them the ability to get rid of those defects by themselves.

      on LowfatBagel not doing anything.

      to a tray.
  - bugfix: Fixed NO_BLOOD species being able to drink infinite amounts of blood without
      consuming it from the container.

      inside of reagents container)
  gbasood:
  - tweak: Fireball no longer creates heavy explosions, meaning it both deals less
      damage and will not breach floors.
  - tweak: Fireball now does double its previous damage to those in direct proximity

  help-maint:
  - tweak: Roundstart insulated gloves in Boxstation now spawn in a random location
      of their room, so Telesci cannot metagame them

      very generic drinks like 'Paper Cup' and 'Cup Ramen' (juices and other such
      dispenser items unchanged)
  - spellcheck: you no longer 'take a gulp of Paper Cup'. you now 'take a gulp _of
      the_ paper cup'. this has been done with several different drinks, namely generic
      items that don't have proper names
  - spellcheck: added a period somewhere
  - spellcheck: bellow vs below
  - tweak: fixes the consistency issue of 'analyser' vs. 'analyzer'
  - tweak: double s's with a lisp no longer say 'thth', which is a sound no one makes,
      but 'thh'.
  - tweak: changes the mutation text to one consistent color, but italicized the plant
      names
  - tweak: vox in roles that use the engineering survival box now get an extended
      nitrogen tank and a vox mask, instead of an oxygen tank and a regular mask

      Generator and Nuclear Generator will be deactivated when the mecha is affected

2021-05-11:
  help-maint:
  - bugfix: Fixed that transplanting a head/brain onto the body of someone who had
      suicided would not let you revive them due to the game thinking they had suicided
      too. Also fixed being able to revive suiciders by headswapping them to a monkeyman
      body.
  kane-f:
  - rscadd: Constructable fuse bombs are here! Made with a surgical drill on an iron
      cannonball, welding fuel and cable coil, these are slightly more destructive

  ShiftyRail:
  - bugfix: Fixes things with dynamic mode
  help-maint:
  - rscadd: Added Locutogen, a chemical made from Piccolyn, Inacusiate, and Sugar.
      Locutogen will remember the first sentence it hears, and then replay that sentence
      in the head of anyone that eats it.
  - rscadd: Paroxetine (the chemical) now prevents you from suiciding, and will revert
      suicides if you can medicate someone with it before they die. No luck if they
      die before you get there though.

      of paper.
  kane-f:
  - rscadd: Antimatter control units, radiation collectors, disposals bins, P.A.C.M.A.N.s,

2021-05-24:
  robintime:
  - tweak: the mailman uniform now properly lays on the body
2021-05-25:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: The Astral Journey cult rune has been completely reworked.
  - rscadd: Using the rune no longer sends the user into sleep, allowing them to move
      as soon as they interrupt the ritual.
  - imageadd: Improved the sprite generation of the cultified ghosts in general. The
      uniform and suit are now featured and partially truncated so only the upper
      body is visible.
  - rscadd: Astral projections can now toggle (with a 5 sec cooldown) between a tangible
      and an intangible state.
  - rscadd: While intangible (the default) astral projections can move around like
      ghosts as usual, see in the dark, and now passively have the Seer rune's convertibility
      HUD, allowing cultists to plan for potential converts to abduct from the safety
      of their base. But most importantly, when speaking while intangible the player
      will speak directly into cult chat, giving them the ability to help coordinate
      their peers with unprecedented efficiency.
  - rscadd: While tangible however, the projection becomes visible and looks just
      like the user. Even tricking examination and sechuds (medhuds however will not
      appear over their heads). They are fairly limited still when it comes to physical
      interactions, they can bump into doors and casually talk with people, but they
      are completely unable to pick up any item, press any button or pull any object.
      Furthermore they will get dispelled should they take the slightest amount of
      damage. Their role is to either allow the cult to safely converse with the crew
      after their identity has been exposed, or to cause mischief. And if nothing
      else, to spook the crew.
  - rscadd: In either state, the projection will be dispelled should you move it to
      another Z-Level, or should your body be moved away from the rune (or from the
      tile if it was triggered from a talisman). If your body dies while still on
      top of the rune, your shade will materialize at the current location of your
      astral projection.
  - rscadd: To complement those changes, cult hoods now have a button that lets cultists
      hide their face and voice, potentially giving them the ability to perform highly
      visible deeds without necessarily compromising their identity (as long as they
      don't forget to remove their ID).
  - bugfix: Engineering hard hats now have their sprite properly update on the player
      when toggling their light bulb.
  kane-f:
  - rscadd: Space stations now recognise international clown day

      maps.
  - bugfix: Players are now properly able to use the resist verb to escape the sticky
      webs from a Spider Queen's projectile, or a thrown Blood Dagger. Previously
      players had to click the trap, now both options are available as intended.
  - bugfix: Removed Component AI Spiders from the possible mob types that the Menagerie
      artifact effect can turn you into.
  - tweak: Removed the extra lightswitch in the bar backroom on Box, and moved the
      other light switch as well as the Kitchen's next to the door to their respective
      backroom, allowing the light to be toggled from either side in both areas.
  - rscadd: The Safe has had its functionality and UI refreshed a bit. Instead of
      bringing up an annoying html pop-up, clicking the Safe now brings up a radial
      menu featuring the safe's dial at the center and two buttons to rotate it. Immersion!
      Furthermore the Safe now opens by itself as soon as both tumblers are properly
      aligned and its contents will immediately appear on top of it. Clicking the
      safe while it's open with an item will place said item on top of it, while clicking
      it with an empty hand will close it, moving the items on top inside it, and
      randomize the tumblers' positions.
  - rscadd: You can now use a screwdriver on an open Safe to randomize the tumblers'
      unlock positions if you want.
  - tweak: The Safe's maximum capacity is now 30 items of any w_class, just like crates
      and closets, instead of its max capacity being limited by the items' combined
      w_class.
  - soundadd: The Safe now makes some sounds! A few brand new SFXs have been added.
  - bugfix: Fixed a very rare bug where the Safe's tumblers were set in a way that
      prevented players from ever cracking the Safe open.
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - rscadd: Revolutionaries can again trigger an announcement at a high enough conversion
      rate, leading to loud music to wake up the masses.

  - rscadd: Medic armor vest, made by using a green crayon on a sec vest. Use bleach
      to return to original skin.
  - rscadd: Trauma Team hardsuit, currently only available by bus
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Organ Failure random events now have their own custom command alert instead
      of using a Biohazard Alert of random level (also more appropriate as there is
      no outbreak to contain here).
  - rscadd: The Biohazard Alert level during a viral infection event or viral outbreak
      event is now proportional to the actual combined danger of the disease's effects.
      It can be as low as 1, and all the way to 8 if the combined danger is 15 or
      16 which are the highest possible currently (disregarding adminbus). 9 as always
      is reserved for Blob.
  - bugfix: Fixed the admin buttons to "Toggle a Lights Out" or a "Prison Break"  not
      using the correct events.
  - bugfix: Fixed the admin option to create a new disease using an already existing
      pathogen displaying IDs only instead of the disease's full name.
  - bugfix: Fixed Admin-made pathogen not having the ID that was set by its creator.
  - bugfix: Fixed the admin "Trigger a Virus Outbreak" button not working.
  - rscadd: Admins can now trigger a custom outbreak event that will spread a previously
      prepared pathogen among the crew, and display the usual alert after some time
      as passed.
  - rscadd: Non-red blood in a drinking glass will now have a fake name slightly more
      believable than Tomato Juice.
  - rscadd: Added a couple new items to the Safe loot table.
  - bugfix: Fixed emitter goggles not working on mannequins
  - bugfix: Fixed glasses mapped onto mannequins not being properly equipped when
      the map loads
  - bugfix: Fixed items removed by monkeys from their backpack having a full-tile
      hitbox.
  - bugfix: Fixed humans no longer having bloody hands unless they're wearing gloves.
  - bugfix: Fixed surgery steps that should bloody your hands no longer doing so.
  - rscadd: The Write in Blood verb has been reworked. Both ghosts and humans now
      have it at all time under the Ghost and IC tab respectively. When using it you
      will attempt to write on your tile. Ghosts need to be either visible, or the
      cult must have reached the bloodstone phase. They will look for a blood splatter
      or footprint in an adjacent tile, if there are several they will get the option
      of which one to use, along with the source's color hex code. Humans however
      need blood on their hands or gloves and will use that one. You can preview your
      message before confirming like when using a crayon. There can be only one doodle
      per tile, and it carries DNA and color from the source blood. Also unlike the
      old bloody doodles, those are maptext'd, and can be read without being examined.
  - rscadd: Punching someone on a limb that is currently bleeding will splash their
      blood on your hands.
  - bugfix: Fixed dead mice still being able to nibble
  - tweak: Increased the layer at which remains appear. They appear now above tables
      but still below objects. As such they are no longer hidden by things like vents,
      scrubbers and pipe.
  - bugfix: When hitting someone with a weapon, should you miss the intended target
      limb and hit another limb, the chat will now correctly report which limb has
      been hit.
  - bugfix: Bomberman Spawns no longer invisible to ghosts who had darkness toggled
      off
  - bugfix: Bomberman Arenas no longer have their name in the corner set up incorrectly
      and showing up as literally just "name"
  - bugfix: Clothing in Bomerman Arenas  no longer remain on the ground after a round.
  - tweak: Reworked rag smothering to fix a few bugs. The new implementation requires
      you to target the rag at their mouth with a 1 second delay (a visible warning
      and SFX play as soon as an attempt is made). Species that do not breath cannot
      be smothered. People wearing smoke-blocking masks such as gas masks, internals,
      clown masks, surgical masks or cigarettes (if they're lit) cannot be smothered
      either. Upon success, all reagents inside the rag will be transferred inside
      the target (up to 5u).
  - bugfix: You no longer try to wipe down people that you are currently smothering
      or bandaging with a rag.
  - bugfix: You no longer try to wipe down the Sink when you fill up your rag.
  - tweak: Cultists now stop dancing while incapacitated, or when muted by holy water.
      This includes constructs when they are purged by a null rod.
  - bugfix: Cultists with the Chameleon gene no longer remain invisible while dancing.
  - rscadd: Cultists can now DANCE wherever using say "*cultdance". They will dance
      around the tile in front of them, so for the best looks do it in an open area.
      If other cultists uses the emote while adjacent to the first cultist's "dance
      center", they will join up and dance in sync. Up to 4 cultists may dance together
      without bumping into each other (as unlike the sacrifice/bloodstone dance, this
      one doesn't use forceMove)
  - tweak: You now need to be on help intent to reveal runes using a null rod. This
      means that you no longer get extra delay added to your attacks when using one
      to fight and missing by clicking the floor.
  - bugfix: Fixed mindless Wraiths appearing if you removed an amorphous mask that
      turns you into a Wraith when reaching the end of an Ethereal Jaunt.
  - experiment: Added a new Traitor Botanist uplink item, the Bee-Nade, which has
      been reworked to in fact spawn hornets that will immediately seek a target when
      they spawn. They also ignore the one who primed the spawner grenade, just like
      viscerators do. Cost 16 (Discount 8)
  - experiment: The Hornet Queen Packet traitor item has been replaced with a Deployable
      Wild Hornet Hive. Place it, throw it, drop it, but be careful as it cannot be
      picked up again once deployed. Those behave exactly like those from random events,
      except they spawn with less hornets inside, giving you a few seconds to get
      away before they start coming out. Cost 10 (Discount 5)
  - experiment: The swarm coming out of a Bee Briefcase now performs an attack as
      soon as it comes out of the briefcase, greatly increasing its lethal power.
      The TC cost has been slightly adjusted to match its increased lethality. Cost
      12 (Discout 6)
  - experiment: Bees and the likes now attack AFTER moving instead of before. This
      effectively increases their attack range, and so their dangerousness.
  - tweak: Bees that spawn from vermin infestations and hornets of all kind now immediately
      become angry again after their calmed status has expired instead of going back
      to their hive or to roaming.
  - rscadd: Bee and Hornet gatling guns bullets no longer deal direct damage, instead
      they immediately cause the spawned bug to attack once on impact. Said attack
      is also guaranteed to pierce bio or impermeable armors.
  - rscadd: Added a chillbug gatling gun. It doesn't deal damage of course but will
      inject 1u chillwax into players hit by the projectile.
  - rscadd: Added both the hornetgun and chillgun to Summon Guns.
  - bugfix: Bees and the likes can no longer attack through one-sided windows and
      windoors.
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to stomp snails when on harm intent.
  - bugfix: You can no longer convert the same mob several times (should they refuse
      and get restrained) to get additional progression on the Conversion objective.
  - tweak: Converting a mindless monkey (whether still monkey or human) will sacrifice
      them, leaving behind a coffer with a skull
  - bugfix: Space Heaters and Cult Forges can no longer heat up a room that's in a
      vacuum, causing mobs to take damage even though there is no molecules with which
      to exchange temperature.
  - bugfix: Fixed soul blades being offset both in the inventory and on the player
      when stored in the suit slot.
  - rscadd: All condiment bottles can have their content spilled over the floor if
      they are set to transfer 10 or more units. The amount spilled depends of the
      transferable amount set.
  - rscadd: Spilling 10 or more units of black pepper over the floor will create a
      cleanable mess.
  - imageadd: Tweaked the icons for salt piles and pepper mills.
  - rscadd: Added Holy Salts, a new reagent that can be easily produced by putting
      normal table salt in presence of a 5u catalyst of holy water. Just like salt,
      it will create cleanable piles when 10u of it are spilled over the floor.
  - rscadd: When salt piles are spawned, they now emit particles when they detect
      the presence of cult runes (even if concealed), talismans, tomes, and most other
      cult paraphernelia. After a set amount of time, the runes will be destroyed,
      the talismans and tomes will burn, and the other objects will break and melt
      away. The delay is 5 minutes for regular table salt, and 20 seconds for holy
      salts and starts when the pile is created.
  - rscadd: When a Path Entrance rune or a talisman attuned to a Path Exit rune is
      destroyed by a salt pile, a blood jaunt visible for a short duration will zoom
      toward the corresponding exit, giving the crew a hint as to the location of
      the Path Exit, and potentially a cult base. The jaunt will make a distinctive
      noise once it reaches the exit, letting any cultist near it at the time know
      that their base might be compromised.
  - rscadd: Added a couple more country flag-bearing mugs. Mug boxes such as those
      included in Cafe Equipment supply crates now include a random one each.
  - rscadd: Flag Mugs finally appear filled with liquid when some has been poured
      in them.
  - imageadd: Re-did the in-hand icons for mugs, and added some for all flag mugs.
      Mugs that contain a liquid that has a unique mug sprite no longer appear invisible
      in-hand, and instead use the default mug sprite.
  DrSnips:
  - bugfix: You can now use/work/hit windoors with basic tools again.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Adds plastic to the derelict MoMMI Material Synth.
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: Barbervends now sell scissors which allow actual barbering to take place.
  - rscadd: 4 new grey-specific rigsuits, 3 of which are available at cargo.
  - tweak: Egg cartons now have a small chance to come with a non-standard egg.
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: Hostile mobs are now able to break open firedoors and will fixate less
      on things they cannot reach.
  beesil:
  - rscadd: Adds red comfy chairs, standardizes comfy chair colors to match couches.
  kafovofa:
  - rscadd: Health analyzers highlight their heat reading in red if the target is
      too hot.
  kane-f:
  - bugfix: Ghosts no longer hide request console alerts
  - rscadd: All RCDs are now equipped with modules to transform compressed matter
      into windows and deconstruct them, unless made of plasma.
  - rscadd: Reagant dispensers, chemmaster derivatives, all-in-one grinders, microwaves,
      processors, seed extractors, biogenerators and xenobotany machines now work
      with conveyors.
  - rscadd: Mineral unloading machines are now buildable from circuit imprinters.
  - rscadd: Mineral unloading machines now have 3 matter bins and a capacitor, all
      upgradable for faster unloading and lower power usage.
  - rscadd: Mineral unloading machines can now have their directions tweaked with
      a multitool with ease.
  - rscadd: Mineral unloading machines work like conveyors on machines on the other
      end.
  - tweak: New common mineral machine item, cutting down a lot of redundant code and
      variables.
  - rscadd: Wizards have now learned Curse of the Hangman, a spell obscuring the letters
      in others' spoken words. Cure this by guessing the missing letters, but don't
      make mistakes, or it will reset!
  robintime:
  - spellcheck: punctuates several flavortexts
  - spellcheck: '''this the reinforced wall'' now just says ''the reinforced wall'''
2021-06-05:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed reagent splashing from beakers.
2021-06-06:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Egun beams now have their alpha reduced proportionally to their damage
      when they get dispersed by windows.
  - bugfix: beams no longer lag when firing through a large corridor or into space.
  - bugfix: Fixed full-tile windows not reducing beam damage. It now does it with
      the same efficiency as a single directional window.
  - bugfix: Firing beams straight through a tile featuring directional windows will
      no longer reduce its damage if the window isn't oriented toward (or away) from
      the source of the beam (which means that in most cases, if the beam crosses
      a tile with a window without intersecting with it, it shouldn't lose some of
      its damage)
  - bugfix: Fixed players losing space parallax upon turning into Shades.
  - bugfix: Fixed beams not going through windows facing the other way.
  - bugfix: Fixed beams dealing 0 damage never disappearing.
2021-06-07:
  Apogee-dev:
  - tweak: Makes replicator mommi's emagged eyes red
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Mature Space Vines (kudzu) will now properly spread when an adjacent door
      opens or an adjacent wall is dismantled.
  - bugfix: Fixed Biomass spreading through one-directional windows and firelocks.
  - bugfix: Fixed a very rare bug (actually I've calculated that it had a 4.5 percent
      chance of occurring which isn't THAT rare) where the Safe's tumblers were set
      in a way that prevented players from ever cracking the Safe open. But this time
      for real. No really, I've tested it with extreme values and all that.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Atmospheric Alert Computer appearing to be invisible when broken.
2021-06-08:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused challengers to spawn with no objectives if their
      target was the Trader.
  - rscadd: When cloned you now keep the default language you had when you were scanned.
2021-06-09:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added the white chicken suit I sprited back in 2015 and forgot to actually
      PR all this time. A single costume can be obtained from the AutoDrobe after
      inserting a coin.
  - imageadd: Improved the chicken suit and head in-hand icons.
  - rscadd: Humans have a few new emotes. ok/okay makes an OK sign, thumbup/thumbsup
      makes a thumbs up, thumbdown/thumbsdown makes a thumbs down, and peace makes
      a peace sign.
  - rscadd: Added hand count requirements for those emotes. Having your hands broken
      or amputated will make you unable to perform them.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: On the most foolish of days of the year, janitors lose their income, toiling
      for no monetary compensation.
2021-06-11:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: The scoreboard of the previous round can now be checked at any point by
      clicking the Last Round Information button that is now always available in the
      top right (until the current round ends)
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - rscadd: Adds a fully dysfunctional station for dorfmode events. Room for both
      chilling out in caves and building a functioning station. Includes a derelict
      ship mapped by BurntDevil.
2021-06-12:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed the right panel being much smaller than normal (hopefully)
  - bugfix: You can no longer write in blood as a ghost if the source blood disappeared
      before you finished writing your message.
  - bugfix: You can no longer write in blood if there is no blood left on your hands
      or glove by the time you finish writing your message.
  - tweak: Ghosts can now only write in blood up to a certain amount of tiles from
      the original blood source (before they could daisy-chain messages ad nauseam).
      The max distance depends of the original source's amount of blood. A drip will
      only have a radius of 1. Splatters a radius of 2. Gibs a radius of 5. (Same
      distance as footprints)
  - tweak: Projectiles now have a 75 percent chance of hitting mobs in cages, as long
      as the cover is up.
  - rscadd: Just like artificers can click floors up to 3 tiles away to convert them
      into cult floors, they can now click space tiles to conjure floors over them.
      As when done by clicking the spell button, conjuring a tile instead of converting
      one leads to a longer cooldown.
  - bugfix: Fixed mapped alien embryos not spawning a dead alien larva. Expect to
      find a few dead larvas hidden on some maps.
  - rscadd: All playable mobs now have standardized damage overlays which should help
      players controlling simple_animals noticing when they're taking damage.
  - bugfix: Fixed the brute and oxy damage overlays going away for a second then coming
      back when dying. Those overlays also now come back instantly when re-entering
      a corpse.
  - bugfix: Patched an exploit that allowed players to unload ore boxes using the
      pop-up window from any distance away or even adjacent but otherwise incapacitated,
      which apparently allowed a few people to mess with our shaft miner friends.
  - bugfix: Also fixed ore unloading machines causing all ore boxes in their area
      to dump everything every second, instead of only those in front of them.
  - experiment: Dynamic ruleset picking had its pseudo-RNG tweaked to now consider
      not just the previous round, but all 3 previous rounds, decreasing the odds
      of a ruleset being picked again in a short timespan. The odds are reduced more
      if the round was more recent, and if it fired several times in the previous
      three rounds the odd reductions will stack up. This should help prevent having
      the same ruleset firing several times in a short timespan.
  - experiment: Although note that rulesets that fire when the round was already about
      to end will NOT affect future rounds' ruleset weights.
  - experiment: Syndicate Traitors, both roundstart, latejoin, and midround, are also
      always exempt from this weight reduction.
  - experiment: Primetime rulesets now have lowered threat requirement, which should
      allow them to actually fire if the pop allows it but the Threat is average.
      Basically this means that Blob Tuesdays can finally be a thing. Also note that
      this doesn't affect low pop (if the threat requirement is 90, it will remain
      90 in most cases)
  - bugfix: The holomap on from the PDA Station Holomap app now properly updates when
      moving aboard a vehicle.
  - rscadd: The round end scoreboard now indicates which potions were bought by a
      wizard.
  - bugfix: Fixed scoreboard icons either missing or being wrong.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: Makes the mouser fit inside the handgun holster.
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - tweak: Fixed an exploitable thing and added dorf mommi spawners to dorf.
  kane-f:
  - tweak: Compressed matter implants now only store the activation emote in the memory
      of the implanter instead of the implanted, as with other traitor implants.
  - bugfix: RCDs can no longer be used on windows to remove mysterious invulnerable
      grilles.
2021-06-14:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Removed the random wall vent hidden under a sign at Packedstation's Chemistry
      lab.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where player-controlled zombies could attack while double
      dead (given that zombies are already dead and when you shoot one enough it becomes
      double-dead, although this time two negatives don't turn into a positive)
  - rscadd: Added a new spell for the ancient spellbook, Card Trick! Guess what someone's
      card is and their inventory will completely fill up with the copies of the card!
  - bugfix: '"A card" not "card" description for playing cards.'
2021-06-15:
  DamianX:
  - tweak: Extended can no longer fire with fewer than 30 players.
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Cyborgs still being able to roll Challenger, again.
2021-06-16:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Delivery Chutes not activating if items where inserted via conveyor
      belts.
  - rscadd: Dorfstation now features a defective cloning pod among the other ancient
      cryogenic pods. Ghosts of players who died can click it at least 10 minutes
      after they died to respawn as if they came out of a cloning pod. However this
      means respawning with clone and brain damage, and a guaranteed genetic disability.
      Therefore you can decide for yourself whether to wait and preserve your identity,
      or respawn with a new identity from an ancient cryo pod. Alternatively, wait
      for the crew to set up medbay with a proper cloning pod.
  - rscadd: Added new mannequin types! Using either a marble (obtainable from cargo)
      or wooden (craftable) block, you can now sculpt a human woman, or a corgi. Said
      corgi mannequins can wear items just like real corgis do.
  - rscadd: Spessmen have gotten better at sculpting mannequins, and can now sculpt
      their hair and beards.
  - rscadd: Mannequins mobs, such as those that can be found on the drone ship, or
      created by wizards using a staff of animation on a mannequin, are now able to
      fire the guns in their hands, and benefit from the armor they are wearing.
  - tweak: Flesh to Stone now turns humans, vox, monkeys and corgi into marble mannequins
      instead of statues. This means that items can be attached on them or removed,
      but also that when hit by a bolt of animation, they will fight using the items
      in their hands and benefit from the armor that they are wearing.
  - tweak: Apetrine no longer kills or makes unclonable the mobs trapped in a statue
      if said statue was mostly undamaged (if the mob's HP were above 50 when they
      got trapped) although they will still take a fair bit of damage and might die
      shortly after if not given medical care.
  ShiftyRail:
  - tweak: You can now place mounted frames on top of full-tile windows or directional
      windows oriented in a way to support the light frame.
2021-06-17:
  robintime:
  - rscadd: adds a special box to spawn equipment on dorfstation
  - rscadd: adds an unobtainable, nonreactive version of medcores called hardcores
2021-06-20:
  Allspice:
  - rscadd: Add an ordinary green balloon to the AutoDrobe (requires coin)
  Apogee-dev:
  - bugfix: EMPing a mech now actually EMPs its cell
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: The traitor mime hand-gun's bullets no longer cause shrapnel to appear
      out of thin air.
  - rscadd: The Ore Unloader has had both its appearance and mechanics slightly refreshed.
      It now plays an animation when it forces an ore box to dump its content and
      another one when grabbing items. The new sprite was designed to fit along nicely
      with conveyor belts, and kept the original machine's color scheme.
  - bugfix: Fixed Ore Unloaders not emptying ore boxes.
  - tweak: Pianos, Space Minimoog and Xylophones that come out of the random instrument
      or big band instrument collection supply packs are no longer anchored and can
      be immediately pulled around.
  - tweak: Hydroponic Trays found inside mining surprises on the asteroid no longer
      spawn anchored.
  - bugfix: Dismantling a machine containing more than 50 sheets of a given material
      type now properly gives several sheet stacks.
  - bugfix: Fixed Forgotten Cult Hoods (the red ones) turning into regular cult hoods
      when picked up.
  - experiment: Photography Camera had their underlying mechanics thoroughly reworked,
      which should have fixed most bugs related to them, including some objects being
      invisible, having the wrong orientation, mannequins not wearing clothes on pictures,
      etc...
  - bugfix: Fixed clothing being offset on cyber mannequins.
  - bugfix: Mice and other no-damage animals clicking inflatable shelter will now
      nuzzle them instead of attacking them in vain.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Pitbulls spell icon appearing quite strangely on the round end
      scoreboard.
  - imageadd: Abandoned mining crates now have a dusty look.
  - bugfix: Conveyors belts no longer send items through one-direction windows and
      obstacles if there's a receiving machine such as a disposal chute on the other
      side.
  - tweak: When failing a surgery step because you were operating on a table, or a
      regular roller bed, you will now trigger an actual surgery step failure instead
      of attacking the patient with your tool.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: Irradiated Beans, Re-Fried Beans, Mutated Beans, Off-Color Cheese, Greenish
      Ramen Noodles, Glowing Ramen Noodles, Deep Fried Ramen Noodles, Horse Meat and
      Beff now have a nutrition value.
  - tweak: Irradiated Beans, Greenish Ramen Noodles and Glowing Ramen Noodles have
      a chance to irradiate when metabolizing.
  - tweak: Toxic Waste, Mutated Beans and Greenish Ramen Noodles have a chance to
      poison when metabolizing.
  - tweak: Moon Rocks has a chance to cause brute damage (Because it hates the human
      skeleton) when metabolizing.
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - rscadd: Added a suit storage unit for Trauma Team rigsuits as well as a pair of
      matching magboots, so adminbus and mappers can have some more versatility with
      apogee's cool designs.
  SonixApache:
  - rscadd: agent cards can now be disguised as cargo cards
  - bugfix: mapped corpses now have the correct ID card icons
  TGFH:
  - rscadd: X, Y, Z coordinates added to the ingame comms console logs
