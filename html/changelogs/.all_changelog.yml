      affect mobs inside when destroyed.

      alongside radium recipes, and plasma ones if you can find them some plasma...

  - rscadd: Chefs can purchase a box of with mint candy for 3TC, everyone else pays
      5TC. The mints are perfectly innocuous to regular crewmembers, but will cause

      candy. Getmore sells a pack for 30 credits, while Discount Dan's sells them
      for a coin, as it is one of the rare non toxic items they sell, and that cuts
      into profits. The old vendortron somehow got access to a homemade brand of mints.
  - rscadd: Mint Essence, only available inside mint candy, it is the unrefined version
      of Mint Toxin, being perfectly safe to consume.

      heat (like drinking iced coffee) and gives you an ever so slight boost to sports
      performance (same level as sugar).

  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Regular blob tiles once again (after 7 years) visibly brighten when a
      pulse passes through them. Pulses are emitted by Cores, Nodes, and Overminds.
      So if you see some nearby blob blinking brightly despite no Node being nearby,
      that means the Overmind currently has their attention on you. Hopefully it shouldn't
      cause more CPU usage this time.
  - rscadd: Blob Cores and Nodes now emit light, whose color depends upon which skin
      has been selected
  - tweak: The Blob Core and Node pulse animations once again render above darkness,

  - bugfix: Fixed a sanity issue that occurred when mobs exit a Cryo Tube, Body Scanner,
      DNA Scanner, Mecha, or Cyborg Recharging Station through teleportation or getting
      pulled by a hookshot chain, and that would either allow other players to teleport
      them back to it, or just prevent the object from being used by other players.
  - rscadd: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Players that have no roles when the clock hits the automated
      ERT call now become Survivors. Latejoiners that don''t have Traitor enabled
      get that role as well.'
  - tweak: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Changed some of the messages sent to latejoin traitors
      to have them better notice that this isn''t a regular antag roll.'
  - tweak: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Attempting to call the ERT early will now always result
      in a failure (note that it won''t prevent the automated ERT call to occur after
      20 minutes).'
  - tweak: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Reduced the ERT call delay from 20 to 18 minutes (so the
      ERT may actually arrive at the Station after 20 minutes)'
  - tweak: 'ANTAG MADNESS: During that mode, the Blob-related biohazard announcement
      will now trigger much later, but the Blob will also be unable to spawn any additional
      Blob Cores.'
  - bugfix: 'ANTAG MADNESS: Fixed Nanotrasen Officials not getting their Survive objective
      unless they latejoined.'
  - tweak: If a faction's defeat is supposed to reduce the security level and call
      the shuttle, it will only do so if no other faction also has the shuttle under

      by Wizards summoning guns.

  Kurfursten:

  jellyveggie2:
  - rscadd: Pressure valves can now also compare temperature, and have been renamed
      to conditional valves.
  - tweak: Conditional valves can now also compare the control pipe against the input
      pipes' gases, rather than just a fixed value.
  - tweak: Conditional valves can now also forego the side input entirely, using either
      of the two other pipes as control. This might help make some designs neater
      and more compact.
  - rscdel: Conditional valves can no longer be controlled via AAC, beyond simple
      on/off commands.
  nervere:
  - rscadd: Deadchat is now notified when and where a player dies, with an option

  - bugfix: Slimepeople can be cloned once more. Simply put the slime puddle inside
      the cloning machine and scan. Make sure it has its slime core (brain) inside
      or it won't work!
  - tweak: Slimepeople now take toxins damage when cloning instead of clone damage.
      This is to prevent them from instantly cloning (as they're immune to cloneloss),
      while also providing a way for xenobio to ease their cloning process (through
      giving them a slime heart).
  - bugfix: The PDA pinpointer will no longer display negative values when showing
      the time until its next scan.
  smonkeM:
  - rscadd: Added one new reagent, one new spray bottle, and added this to the AutoDrobe's
      contraband section
  - rscdel: Apparently I deleted two lines somewhere. And then added two lines. I'm
      an idiot and I don't believe this breaks anything?
2023-07-01:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Mobs can now attack blob tiles empty handed. Obviously puny humans won't
      do much damage at all given its inherent resistance to brute damage, but at
      least this allow mobs like aliums and constructs to do decent damage to the
      blob. Blob tiles also now take damage from thrown objects.

      even if those had a prescription version.

      Health Scanner Glasses. They can also now be printed at R&D, and both them and
