2021-06-12:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed the right panel being much smaller than normal (hopefully)
  - bugfix: You can no longer write in blood as a ghost if the source blood disappeared
      before you finished writing your message.
  - bugfix: You can no longer write in blood if there is no blood left on your hands
      or glove by the time you finish writing your message.
  - tweak: Ghosts can now only write in blood up to a certain amount of tiles from
      the original blood source (before they could daisy-chain messages ad nauseam).
      The max distance depends of the original source's amount of blood. A drip will
      only have a radius of 1. Splatters a radius of 2. Gibs a radius of 5. (Same
      distance as footprints)
  - tweak: Projectiles now have a 75 percent chance of hitting mobs in cages, as long
      as the cover is up.
  - rscadd: Just like artificers can click floors up to 3 tiles away to convert them
      into cult floors, they can now click space tiles to conjure floors over them.
      As when done by clicking the spell button, conjuring a tile instead of converting
      one leads to a longer cooldown.
  - bugfix: Fixed mapped alien embryos not spawning a dead alien larva. Expect to
      find a few dead larvas hidden on some maps.
  - rscadd: All playable mobs now have standardized damage overlays which should help
      players controlling simple_animals noticing when they're taking damage.
  - bugfix: Fixed the brute and oxy damage overlays going away for a second then coming
      back when dying. Those overlays also now come back instantly when re-entering
      a corpse.
  - bugfix: Patched an exploit that allowed players to unload ore boxes using the
      pop-up window from any distance away or even adjacent but otherwise incapacitated,
      which apparently allowed a few people to mess with our shaft miner friends.
  - bugfix: Also fixed ore unloading machines causing all ore boxes in their area
      to dump everything every second, instead of only those in front of them.
  - experiment: Dynamic ruleset picking had its pseudo-RNG tweaked to now consider
      not just the previous round, but all 3 previous rounds, decreasing the odds
      of a ruleset being picked again in a short timespan. The odds are reduced more
      if the round was more recent, and if it fired several times in the previous
      three rounds the odd reductions will stack up. This should help prevent having
      the same ruleset firing several times in a short timespan.
  - experiment: Although note that rulesets that fire when the round was already about
      to end will NOT affect future rounds' ruleset weights.
  - experiment: Syndicate Traitors, both roundstart, latejoin, and midround, are also
      always exempt from this weight reduction.
  - experiment: Primetime rulesets now have lowered threat requirement, which should
      allow them to actually fire if the pop allows it but the Threat is average.
      Basically this means that Blob Tuesdays can finally be a thing. Also note that
      this doesn't affect low pop (if the threat requirement is 90, it will remain
      90 in most cases)
  - bugfix: The holomap on from the PDA Station Holomap app now properly updates when
      moving aboard a vehicle.
  - rscadd: The round end scoreboard now indicates which potions were bought by a
      wizard.
  - bugfix: Fixed scoreboard icons either missing or being wrong.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: Makes the mouser fit inside the handgun holster.
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - tweak: Fixed an exploitable thing and added dorf mommi spawners to dorf.
  kane-f:
  - tweak: Compressed matter implants now only store the activation emote in the memory
      of the implanter instead of the implanted, as with other traitor implants.
  - bugfix: RCDs can no longer be used on windows to remove mysterious invulnerable
      grilles.
2021-06-14:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Removed the random wall vent hidden under a sign at Packedstation's Chemistry
      lab.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where player-controlled zombies could attack while double
      dead (given that zombies are already dead and when you shoot one enough it becomes
      double-dead, although this time two negatives don't turn into a positive)
  - rscadd: Added a new spell for the ancient spellbook, Card Trick! Guess what someone's
      card is and their inventory will completely fill up with the copies of the card!
  - bugfix: '"A card" not "card" description for playing cards.'
2021-06-15:
  DamianX:
  - tweak: Extended can no longer fire with fewer than 30 players.
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Cyborgs still being able to roll Challenger, again.
2021-06-16:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Delivery Chutes not activating if items where inserted via conveyor
      belts.
  - rscadd: Dorfstation now features a defective cloning pod among the other ancient
      cryogenic pods. Ghosts of players who died can click it at least 10 minutes
      after they died to respawn as if they came out of a cloning pod. However this
      means respawning with clone and brain damage, and a guaranteed genetic disability.
      Therefore you can decide for yourself whether to wait and preserve your identity,
      or respawn with a new identity from an ancient cryo pod. Alternatively, wait
      for the crew to set up medbay with a proper cloning pod.
  - rscadd: Added new mannequin types! Using either a marble (obtainable from cargo)
      or wooden (craftable) block, you can now sculpt a human woman, or a corgi. Said
      corgi mannequins can wear items just like real corgis do.
  - rscadd: Spessmen have gotten better at sculpting mannequins, and can now sculpt
      their hair and beards.
  - rscadd: Mannequins mobs, such as those that can be found on the drone ship, or
      created by wizards using a staff of animation on a mannequin, are now able to
      fire the guns in their hands, and benefit from the armor they are wearing.
  - tweak: Flesh to Stone now turns humans, vox, monkeys and corgi into marble mannequins
      instead of statues. This means that items can be attached on them or removed,
      but also that when hit by a bolt of animation, they will fight using the items
      in their hands and benefit from the armor that they are wearing.
  - tweak: Apetrine no longer kills or makes unclonable the mobs trapped in a statue
      if said statue was mostly undamaged (if the mob's HP were above 50 when they
      got trapped) although they will still take a fair bit of damage and might die
      shortly after if not given medical care.
  ShiftyRail:
  - tweak: You can now place mounted frames on top of full-tile windows or directional
      windows oriented in a way to support the light frame.

  - bugfix: EMPing a mech now actually EMPs its cell
  DeityLink:
  - tweak: The traitor mime hand-gun's bullets no longer cause shrapnel to appear
      out of thin air.
  - rscadd: The Ore Unloader has had both its appearance and mechanics slightly refreshed.
      It now plays an animation when it forces an ore box to dump its content and
      another one when grabbing items. The new sprite was designed to fit along nicely
      with conveyor belts, and kept the original machine's color scheme.
  - bugfix: Fixed Ore Unloaders not emptying ore boxes.
  - tweak: Pianos, Space Minimoog and Xylophones that come out of the random instrument
      or big band instrument collection supply packs are no longer anchored and can
      be immediately pulled around.
  - tweak: Hydroponic Trays found inside mining surprises on the asteroid no longer
      spawn anchored.
  - bugfix: Dismantling a machine containing more than 50 sheets of a given material
      type now properly gives several sheet stacks.
  - bugfix: Fixed Forgotten Cult Hoods (the red ones) turning into regular cult hoods
      when picked up.
  - experiment: Photography Camera had their underlying mechanics thoroughly reworked,
      which should have fixed most bugs related to them, including some objects being
      invisible, having the wrong orientation, mannequins not wearing clothes on pictures,
      etc...
  - bugfix: Fixed clothing being offset on cyber mannequins.
  - bugfix: Mice and other no-damage animals clicking inflatable shelter will now
      nuzzle them instead of attacking them in vain.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Pitbulls spell icon appearing quite strangely on the round end
      scoreboard.
  - imageadd: Abandoned mining crates now have a dusty look.
  - bugfix: Conveyors belts no longer send items through one-direction windows and
      obstacles if there's a receiving machine such as a disposal chute on the other
      side.
  - tweak: When failing a surgery step because you were operating on a table, or a
      regular roller bed, you will now trigger an actual surgery step failure instead
      of attacking the patient with your tool.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: Irradiated Beans, Re-Fried Beans, Mutated Beans, Off-Color Cheese, Greenish
      Ramen Noodles, Glowing Ramen Noodles, Deep Fried Ramen Noodles, Horse Meat and
      Beff now have a nutrition value.
  - tweak: Irradiated Beans, Greenish Ramen Noodles and Glowing Ramen Noodles have
      a chance to irradiate when metabolizing.
  - tweak: Toxic Waste, Mutated Beans and Greenish Ramen Noodles have a chance to
      poison when metabolizing.
  - tweak: Moon Rocks has a chance to cause brute damage (Because it hates the human
      skeleton) when metabolizing.
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - rscadd: Added a suit storage unit for Trauma Team rigsuits as well as a pair of
      matching magboots, so adminbus and mappers can have some more versatility with
      apogee's cool designs.
  ShiftyRail:
  - experiment: A new lighting system is used in place of Goonlights.
  - rscadd: This system is darker, with objects casting shadows.
  - rscadd: 'It allows for many effects: flickering of light sources, objects glowing
      in the dark, more control on the shape of light sources, etc.'
  - rscadd: Some objects - supermatter shards, AME cores, glow in the dark.
  - rscadd: Firecamps emit more light.
  - rscadd: The system is lighter on the server than goonlights.
  - bugfix: This new system fixes the problem of goonlights bleeding over walls.
  - experiment: 'All maps have been heavily reworked to accommodate for this new system.
      Your feedback is requested on this new lighting layout: report anything that
      may appear out of place.'
  SonixApache:
  - rscadd: agent cards can now be disguised as cargo cards
  - bugfix: mapped corpses now have the correct ID card icons
  TGFH:
  - rscadd: X, Y, Z coordinates added to the ingame comms console logs

      come across!

  DamianX:
  - bugfix: Doctor's Delight will now be properly highlighted when it's a syndicate
      code word.
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed the numpad no longer letting you type numbers.
  - tweak: To change which zone you're targeting using the numpad, you now have to
      hold the ALT key down at the same time (except for hands and feet that still
      require you to hold down CTRL)
  - tweak: Hostile mobs no longer destroy firelocks that are either open, or welded
      down.
  - imageadd: Headcrab zombies have a new sprite looking more akin to their HL2 counterparts,
      including also a clothed version used when the zombie is spawned by other means
      than an actual headcrab, such as gold slimes or amorpheous masks.
  - bugfix: Fixed multiple bugs linked to headcrab zombie death, including deadly
      lag occuring when an amorphous mask wearer transmogrified as one gets killed.
  - rscdel: Facehuggers and Headcrabs no longer try to sneak themselves among other
      articles of clothing at Spessmart.

      of two if less than ten players readied-up.
  - experiment: The goon satellite vault has a new unique reward in its display case.
      Though you can still find the goon code tossed on the floor beside it.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: The Biogenerators can make extra slime bags as an alternative source of
      said bags.
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: 'New wizard spell: Invoke Emotion.'

      access or power than Traders! Non-crew members of any race spawn in a shack

  - rscadd: Traitor mimes can now purchase a spellbook teaching them how to conjure
      invisible un-walls. When active on a tile, mimes can cross over anything on
      it regardless of density.
2021-06-25:
  Apogee-dev:
  - rscadd: Crate & chest mimics can be wrapped and shipped over disposals.
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: Lowfat Bagel's Virology has underwent reconstruction. We're hoping
      you'll find the final product a little more functional.
  - rscadd: The critter cage in there also now actually features a pet lab mice instead
      of being desperately empty.
  - bugfix: Fixed humans not getting their hands bloody when punching people in their
      bleeding arms, legs, hands or feet.
  - rscadd: You can now write using your own blood if your hands are bleeding and
      you're not wearing any gloves. The future is looking bright for chaplain cultists.

      job-exclusive uplink items.

      inside pockets.
  - experiment: Giant Spider vision has been reworked, fixing transparency issues
      among other things.
  - experiment: Catulism Syndrom (stage 3) now actually provides much improved vision
      in the dark. Tajarans also benefit from it by default. Incidentally, so can
      other human species should they have tajaran eyes implanted through surgery.
  - experiment: Mushroom people also see better in the dark by default, but not quite
      as good as Tajarans, however their genetic spell now lets them switch to a different
      mode of perception that let's them see even better in dark areas than lit ones.
  - experiment: Lastly Constructs can also see a bit better in the dark, although
      with a red tinge.

  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Hobo shacks are now hidden on the minimap.

      or dynamic rulesets. Both rulesets and events can still be forced manually by
      admins while the toggle is off.
  - tweak: The Research Outposts airlocks on box, roid, and metaclub, all feature
      a second large dual-port vent, which should cut down by half the time it takes

      nest.
  - bugfix: The mobs coming out of a Master Trainer Belt's capsules finally ignore
      the agent who bought the belt as intended.
  - tweak: Mobs in capsules no longer have a chance to perform their random emotes
      or say their random lines. Rogue Drones in capsules also no longer emit sparks
      randomly.
  - bugfix: Fixed Hex spawned by the Master Trainer Belt having invisible lights
  - bugfix: You no longer share contact diseases with someone after a punch or disarm
      that missed.
  - bugfix: Biting and Kicking can now properly transmit contact diseases, checking
      sterility on your feet instead of your hands in the case of kicking, and bypassing
      bleeding checks (and sterility checks on your own face) in the case of biting,
      which means that you can now bite people to transmit them your own (or get their)
      blood-only diseases (still needs to pass the sterility check on the target as
      well as the infection chance roll though). This applies to monkeys as well since
      they always attack by biting, but not to mice whose teeth aren't quite big enough.
  - bugfix: Fixed the borer development lab's airlocks being called borer devolopment.
  bathosbathtime:
  - rscadd: Bartenders and detectives no longer spawn with their inactive genetic
      defects activated
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: You can now emag tile painters.
  kane-f:

      the fuel)

  - rscadd: Centcomm and syndicate console messages as well as faxes are now logged,
      and sent to non-playing admins along with prayers.
2021-07-12:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added wristwatches to the game, a new uniform accessory. Their hands move
      in real time on their sprite, and you can click it to get the current station
      time down to the second. Can be purchased from the merch computer at the Cargo
      Lobby.
  - rscadd: They can also extremely rarely be found from maintenance loot spawners,
      and tourists coming out of Ancient Cryopods have one equipped as a reference
      to the old long-time layering glitch that caused their right arm to appear to
      wear a red strap.
  - rscadd: Captains spawn with a unique golden wristwatch. Although there is a small
      chance of getting another one from the Vault's safe.
  - rscadd: There is also a sleek black variant that can be rarely found from maint
      spawners. Nuclear Operatives spawn equipped with those, as time is of the essence
      in their field.
  - rscadd: Finally a pocket watch variant can be dug up frome house/dwellings digsites
      on the asteroid. Let your local xenoarchaeologist know if you're interested
      in getting one.
  - imageadd: Special thanks to terrel for providing the gold, black, and pocket watch
      sprites.
  - rscadd: Added a new machine, the Photo Booth. Can be entered by just walking inside
      from the front, clicking it while inside will buckle you in there for a few
      seconds, then after a few seconds an ID photo will pop out of the machine. There
      will be at least one on each map, until then you can build them from R&D. You
      can also Alt Click the booth to select one of several backgrounds.
  - rscadd: ID Photo are a new subtype of photos. Just like regular photos you can
      write on them, use them on newscasters, but more importantly, when using them
      on a Security or Medical Records computer open on a given entry, you can scan
      the photo on the computer to update the entry's photo. Until now, new records
      created at a Security Computer were damned to never have any picture, this changes
      at last!
  - rscadd: Added scissors. They're basically just wirecutters with a different sprite.
      You can print them at an autolathe from the Misc Tools category. You can use
      them (or any type of wirecutter) on an ID photo to split it into 4 regular photos.
      Those individual photos CANNOT be used to update records.
  - bugfix: Fixed the same player being picked several times at once to be a wizard
      during Civil War of Casters, and ending up with more Spell Books at their disposal
      while other players get cucked out of their antag roll.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Plant-B-Gone stops dionae healing from light.
2021-07-14:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added a new Danger 4 Stage 3 disease effect, Piratitis Syndrome. The infected
      will periodically lose some of their teeth and start talking like a pirate.
  - bugfix: Fixed the photo booth board appearing in the wrong category and printing
      a teleporter console board instead
  - bugfix: Mice (both observers and plague mice) will no longer spawn in the supermatter
      chamber, as well as in Virology or Xenobiology if their vents aren't connected
      to the rest of the station.
  - tweak: Getting disfigured now causes your hair and beard to no longer appear.
      Getting decapitated while disfigured causes the spawned head to be labelled
      as a disfigured head.
  - bugfix: When infected with several diseases all featuring the same symptoms that
      activate when touching or bumping into someone (namely Porokeratosis Acanthus
      and Epidermolysis Bullosa), only the first instance of each symptom type will
      activate per bump. So no more crit'ing people in a single bump while infected
      with 50 duplicates of the same disease, that symptom is deadly enough on its
      own already.
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: Centcomm Encryption Keys are now called Syndicate Encryption Keys in the

      collectors and antimatter decelerators.

      (such as an AI holopad's virtualhearer) by using a coffin's AltClick property.
      Observers could also unbuckle mobs buckled inside coffins, and anyone could
      do it at any distance.
  - tweak: Buckling and Un-buckling from a coffin is now done via mouse-dragging,
      just like in a sleeper. AltClicking does nothing anymore, and clicking toggles
      normally the coffin open or closed. On that note, you can now properly close
      coffins while people are buckled in them.
  - bugfix: Fixed being unable to put cardboard in a microwave if there was only one
      sheet in the stack.
  Eneocho:

      a welder (file cabinet, weight machine) or a crowbar (cabinet).
  - rscadd: Secure cabinets can now be made by adding airlock electronics to a wooden
      cabinet.
  - tweak: While open, secure cabinets (detective, bar, wondrous wardrobe) can now
      be dismantled into wood and airlock electronics with a crowbar instead of welded
      into metal like a normal secure locker.
  - tweak: Weight machines can now be anchored and deanchored with a wrench.
  DamianX:
  - tweak: All job preferences have been reset because the way they are stored in
      the database has changed.

      after the symptom has activated 60 times.
  - tweak: Also increased the chance for Wizarditis to cause spell casting from 3
      percent per activation to 20 percent.
  - tweak: Magnitis has been buffed quite a lot from the near-invisible symptom it
      was until now. The Symptom no longer has to pass two probability checks to activate
      instead of one. Its area of effect has also been increased by 1 tile for each
      three levels of intensity (which increases after the first 10 and 20 activations,
      to 3 tiles, to 6 tiles, to 9 tiles.)
  - experiment: A satellite has been observed drifting through Nanotrasen space which
      is believed to be the testing grounds of a new experimental type of AME. Whatever
      tests were done there appear to have stopped and the satellite was evacuated
      in a hurry. The satellite itself was deemed too unsafe to properly decommission
      so it is still drifting through space to this day. Regardless, do not go near
      it. Do not board it. And by all means Do Not try to resume the experiments that
      were happening there.
  - bugfix: Fixed NO_BLOOD human species still creating blood splatters when getting
      ZAS-slammed.
  - rscadd: The AME has gotten a bit of TLC, featuring new sounds, animations, a properly
      scaled UI that updates when interacted with, and the packaged reactor sections
      have gotten a new sprite and more importantly update the surrounding shield
      parts immediately after being deployed. The cores also emit a tiny bit of light
      when the AME is active. Finally the jars themselves now have in-hand icons,
      and feature a gauge on their side that displays how much fuel they have.
  - bugfix: Fixed blob meteors sometimes spawning adjacent duplicate blobs.
  - bugfix: Removed duplicate cables under Roidstation Engineering's SMES
  - tweak: Suiciding while holding one of the cyanide pills that Nuke Ops spawn with
      now instantly deals you all the damage that it would have done to you over time.
      That's 500 toxloss and 500 oxyloss, so basically an instant death without having
      to suicide AND succumb.
  - bugfix: Fixes examining people wearing accessories indicating "it has nothing"
      when there are in fact accessories
  - rscadd: Slimes processed inside a Slime Extractor now provide points to the crew
      score. The points provided remain constant regardless of the slime type, or
      whether it was on steroid.
  - tweak: Virology score for isolated antibodies has been substantially increased
      to account for the fact that each antibody can only be isolated once.
  - bugfix: Player-controlled Mice and Spiderlings are now prevented from spawning
      from vents on the Vox and Brig Outposts on RoidStation's main Station Z Level
      as those aren't connected to the rest of the main station's atmos.

  DamianX:
  - rscadd: The suit modification station can now repaint plasmaman and vox suits.
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added a new machine, the Data Disk Duplicator. Insert first a data disk
      of any type in the source slot, then insert a blank or corrupted disk in the
      target slot, and after a few second, the target disk will pop out as a carbon
      copy of the source disk, including the various datas that were on it. You can
      print its circuit board at RnD but it's also simple enough that you can also
      use a solding iron on a blank circuit board to craft it. Warranty void if emagged.
  - rscadd: You can now print blank data disks at an autolathe under Misc Items. Diskette
      Boxes bought on the Merch computer already also come with a random amount of
      corrupted disks that finally have a purpose.
  - bugfix: Fixed players walking into splatters despite being in a vehicle.
  - bugfix: Mobs affected by timestop now have their movement capabilities updated
      right as the timestop ends, fixing issues related to status effects being acquired
      during timestop.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: Changed the Sacid recipe for proper stochiometry. In practice, you'll need
      double the oxygen to make any amount. This won't affect chem dispensers or any
      sacid-using recipe, only the ghetto-chem manufacture (or electrolysis) of Sacid.
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: Packed voting requirements have been restored to 0 minimum and 10 maximum.

      Dorfstation.
2021-08-02:

      or the range from the servers. (west3436)
  - tweak: Growth Dishes printed out of an Isolation Centrifuge now spawn offset south
      a bit so the centrifuge's light overlays don't hinder clicking on it. (Killette2)
  - tweak: Node and Core Blob Meteors now have some penetration, meaning they will
      land deeper inside the station, allowing for more interesting fights. When passing
      through obstacles they leave strong blobs, which prevent airflow and the surprise
      venting of areas. (ApogeeSys)
  - tweak: Solar Panels have had their penetration dampening value drastically reduced
      to match their fragility.
  - rscadd: The Blob HUD has been refreshed using the brand new UI datum system that
      we first implemented a few days ago. Beside the back-end changes, the new UI
      has a few new features. The useless Spawn Normal Blob button has been replaced
      with a toggle to restrain automatic expansion through walls. The gauge features
      small symbols that accurately indicate how many points you need to perform certain
      actions, and the Spawn Blob Core icon now tells you explicitly that you need
      to place more Nodes to be able to place more Cores when their cost is higher
      than your point cap. Lastly it also features a new look, with more easily readable
      numbers and graduations.
  - rscadd: When trying to place a special Blob too close from another blob of the
      same type, the game now tells you exactly how close you are from it.
  - rscadd: The right side of the Blob HUD now features two new buttons under the
      Health gauge. One is a shortcut for removing Blob tiles underneath you. The
      other opens a small Help panel listing some of the shortcuts. The gauge itself
      also features a smaller golden gauge on its side that tracks the progress to
      victory.
  - rscadd: Oh also Blob Overminds can now move diagonally.
  - imageadd: Special Blobs once again animate when they Pulse. For example Resource
      blobs emit a puff of purple smoke and Factory blobs play an animation when they
      spawn a Blob Spore.
  - soundadd: The Call Overminds blob power that allows other overminds to jump to
      your location now plays a sound to notify them more reliably.
  - bugfix: Fixed mindless Blob cores not using their cerebrate icon.

      158kb of 780 and sounding higher quality

      picking the login music, saving having to manually add any new tracks to the
      ticker pick list when updating these.

      the main station's.
2021-08-04:

  - rscadd: Added Photo Booths near the HoP offices on most maps. This allows HoPs
      to use their Security Records computer to update the crew's pictures, or add
      pictures to brand new records.
  - tweak: When manually expanding their blob, Overminds will spend only 5 points
      instead of 15 if the expansion didn't lead to a new blob getting created. This
      includes cases such as failing to expand over space, or trying and failing (often
      repeatedly) to break a wall/structure. (You still need 15 points to expand,
      but 10 points get reimbursed in case of failure)
  Eneocho:
  - spellcheck: Adds the missing period to the vending machines' vending messages.
      The "You hear a whirr" and "The [src.name] whirrs as it vends" ones.

      by things like explosions, EMPs, and projectiles. Examining one when it is damaged
      informs you that a solder can be used to repair it. (gurfan)

      of issues where the button would otherwise disappear.

  - bugfix: Fixed the bugs with using the omnitool at range.
