  - rscadd: Added Chill Bugs, a new species of bees. One or two packets of those can
      be found on the Vox outpost. Those bugs imported from Vox worlds need N2 to
      breath and suffocate in Oxygen. They produce a honey-like substance called Chill
      Wax, and while it doesn't heal as efficiently as regular honey does, it has
      the strange property of causing people who ingest it to become unable to perform
      any act of violence. Incidentally, Chill Bugs live up to their name and don't
      get angry ever, and there are only a handful of reagents that can raise their
      hive's toxicity, which makes raising them much easier than raising bees, if
      you can set up proper atmos.
