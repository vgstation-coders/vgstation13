  - imageadd: Fixed a few pipe sprites, namely Heat Exchanger Junctions have a new
      sprite as an item.
  - tweak: Re-arranged some of Boxstation's TEG setup. Removed some useless and redundant
      connectors, and swapped the CO2 canisters with some of the Plasma canisters
      from Engineering storage, so newbies don't get under the impression that CO2
      is meant to be the better choice for those gas loops. (A long time ago those
      were there to help stop fires that'd come out from the burn chamber but CO2
      clearly doesn't do anything in case of fire anymore)

      inside of reagents container)

  - tweak: Fireball no longer creates heavy explosions, meaning it both deals less
      damage and will not breach floors.

      dispenser items unchanged)

      the_ paper cup'. this has been done with several different drinks, namely generic
      items that don't have proper names
  - spellcheck: added a period somewhere
  - spellcheck: bellow vs below
  - tweak: fixes the consistency issue of 'analyser' vs. 'analyzer'

2021-05-11:
  help-maint:
  - bugfix: Fixed that transplanting a head/brain onto the body of someone who had
      suicided would not let you revive them due to the game thinking they had suicided
      too. Also fixed being able to revive suiciders by headswapping them to a monkeyman
      body.
  kane-f:
  - rscadd: Constructable fuse bombs are here! Made with a surgical drill on an iron

      carriers once again. (You may no longer roll more than one antag at a time)
  Zth--:
  - bugfix: Fixes hulks not being able to resist cuffs while buckled
  help-maint:
  - tweak: Fridges now slowly cool items inside them. This serves no practical purpose
      and will virtually never be relevant or noticeable.
  - rscadd: You can now sudoku by suiciding with a pen while holding a blank piece
      of paper.
  kane-f:
  - rscadd: Antimatter control units, radiation collectors, disposals bins, P.A.C.M.A.N.s,
      R-UST fuel assembly ports, R-UST fuel injectors and portable air devices (such
      as canisters) now work with items loaded in via conveyors.
  - bugfix: Supermatter should now behave properly with conveyors.
  - rscadd: Dorf Station can now be voted for on August 8th, the anniversary of the
      release of Dwarf Fortress.
  - rscadd: Grey slime extracts are now available in crates from cargo
  robintime:
  - spellcheck: the centcomm link announcement no longer gives you secondhand embarrassment

  - tweak: the mailman uniform now properly lays on the body
2021-05-25:
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: The Astral Journey cult rune has been completely reworked.
  - rscadd: Using the rune no longer sends the user into sleep, allowing them to move
      as soon as they interrupt the ritual.
  - imageadd: Improved the sprite generation of the cultified ghosts in general. The
      uniform and suit are now featured and partially truncated so only the upper
      body is visible.
  - rscadd: Astral projections can now toggle (with a 5 sec cooldown) between a tangible
      and an intangible state.
  - rscadd: While intangible (the default) astral projections can move around like
      ghosts as usual, see in the dark, and now passively have the Seer rune's convertibility
      HUD, allowing cultists to plan for potential converts to abduct from the safety
      of their base. But most importantly, when speaking while intangible the player
      will speak directly into cult chat, giving them the ability to help coordinate
      their peers with unprecedented efficiency.
  - rscadd: While tangible however, the projection becomes visible and looks just
      like the user. Even tricking examination and sechuds (medhuds however will not
      appear over their heads). They are fairly limited still when it comes to physical
      interactions, they can bump into doors and casually talk with people, but they
      are completely unable to pick up any item, press any button or pull any object.
      Furthermore they will get dispelled should they take the slightest amount of
      damage. Their role is to either allow the cult to safely converse with the crew
      after their identity has been exposed, or to cause mischief. And if nothing
      else, to spook the crew.
  - rscadd: In either state, the projection will be dispelled should you move it to
      another Z-Level, or should your body be moved away from the rune (or from the
      tile if it was triggered from a talisman). If your body dies while still on
      top of the rune, your shade will materialize at the current location of your
      astral projection.
  - rscadd: To complement those changes, cult hoods now have a button that lets cultists
      hide their face and voice, potentially giving them the ability to perform highly
      visible deeds without necessarily compromising their identity (as long as they
      don't forget to remove their ID).
  - bugfix: Engineering hard hats now have their sprite properly update on the player
      when toggling their light bulb.
  kane-f:
  - rscadd: Space stations now recognise international clown day
2021-05-26:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed antag-banned players still being able to apply for midround rulesets.
2021-05-27:
  west3436:
  - rscadd: Chicken Tenders now heal Janitors similarly to how sprinkles heal Security
      members.
  - tweak: Changed "Chicken Fillet" to "Chicken Tenders" for lore consistency.
2021-05-29:
  kafovofa:
  - bugfix: wolves no longer spend nutrition to regen while at full health
  - tweak: wolf regen from 1-3 -> 3 at less than half health and 1 -> 3 while well
      fed
2021-05-30:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed persistent crushed soda cans spawning with a blank name on subsequent
      maps.
  - bugfix: Players are now properly able to use the resist verb to escape the sticky
      webs from a Spider Queen's projectile, or a thrown Blood Dagger. Previously
      players had to click the trap, now both options are available as intended.
  - bugfix: Removed Component AI Spiders from the possible mob types that the Menagerie
      artifact effect can turn you into.
  - tweak: Removed the extra lightswitch in the bar backroom on Box, and moved the
      other light switch as well as the Kitchen's next to the door to their respective
      backroom, allowing the light to be toggled from either side in both areas.
  - rscadd: The Safe has had its functionality and UI refreshed a bit. Instead of
      bringing up an annoying html pop-up, clicking the Safe now brings up a radial
      menu featuring the safe's dial at the center and two buttons to rotate it. Immersion!
      Furthermore the Safe now opens by itself as soon as both tumblers are properly
      aligned and its contents will immediately appear on top of it. Clicking the
      safe while it's open with an item will place said item on top of it, while clicking
      it with an empty hand will close it, moving the items on top inside it, and
      randomize the tumblers' positions.
  - rscadd: You can now use a screwdriver on an open Safe to randomize the tumblers'
      unlock positions if you want.
  - tweak: The Safe's maximum capacity is now 30 items of any w_class, just like crates
      and closets, instead of its max capacity being limited by the items' combined
      w_class.
  - soundadd: The Safe now makes some sounds! A few brand new SFXs have been added.
  - bugfix: Fixed a very rare bug where the Safe's tumblers were set in a way that
      prevented players from ever cracking the Safe open.
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - rscadd: Revolutionaries can again trigger an announcement at a high enough conversion
      rate, leading to loud music to wake up the masses.
  jknpj:
  - rscdel: AIs can no longer use right click to examine turfs when they're outside
      their core view.
  kafovofa:
  - rscadd: The circuit imprinter can print thermal homeostasis regulator boards
  - tweak: Thermal homeostasis regulators are built with micro lasers instead of manipulators
  - rscadd: MEGAMADCRABs give crab meat when butchered.
  kane-f:
  - bugfix: Grey slime extract supply crates are now fitted the proper kinds of crates
      with locks, as they should be.
  - rscadd: 'New custom bar sign filter: Ripple.'
  - rscadd: Custom bar signs can now have their fonts and background color customised
      for each interval.
  - rscadd: Destructive analyzers, smartfridges, monkey recyclers, processors, fourier
      transform and hyperspectral analysers now all accept conveyor loaded items.
  robintime:
  - tweak: changes 'utility belt' to 'tool-belt' in the biogenerator menu
2021-06-04:
  Allspice:
  - bugfix: Re-add NATO alphabet language to deathsquaddies.
  Apogee-dev:
  - bugfix: Dynamic now checks alt titles in addition to job titles for protection
      & restriction from antag roles
  - rscadd: Medic armor vest, made by using a green crayon on a sec vest. Use bleach
      to return to original skin.
  - rscadd: Trauma Team hardsuit, currently only available by bus
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Organ Failure random events now have their own custom command alert instead
      of using a Biohazard Alert of random level (also more appropriate as there is
      no outbreak to contain here).
  - rscadd: The Biohazard Alert level during a viral infection event or viral outbreak
      event is now proportional to the actual combined danger of the disease's effects.
      It can be as low as 1, and all the way to 8 if the combined danger is 15 or
      16 which are the highest possible currently (disregarding adminbus). 9 as always
      is reserved for Blob.
  - bugfix: Fixed the admin buttons to "Toggle a Lights Out" or a "Prison Break"  not
      using the correct events.
  - bugfix: Fixed the admin option to create a new disease using an already existing
      pathogen displaying IDs only instead of the disease's full name.
  - bugfix: Fixed Admin-made pathogen not having the ID that was set by its creator.
  - bugfix: Fixed the admin "Trigger a Virus Outbreak" button not working.
  - rscadd: Admins can now trigger a custom outbreak event that will spread a previously
      prepared pathogen among the crew, and display the usual alert after some time
      as passed.
  - rscadd: Non-red blood in a drinking glass will now have a fake name slightly more
      believable than Tomato Juice.
  - rscadd: Added a couple new items to the Safe loot table.
  - bugfix: Fixed emitter goggles not working on mannequins
  - bugfix: Fixed glasses mapped onto mannequins not being properly equipped when
      the map loads
  - bugfix: Fixed items removed by monkeys from their backpack having a full-tile
      hitbox.
  - bugfix: Fixed humans no longer having bloody hands unless they're wearing gloves.
  - bugfix: Fixed surgery steps that should bloody your hands no longer doing so.
  - rscadd: The Write in Blood verb has been reworked. Both ghosts and humans now
      have it at all time under the Ghost and IC tab respectively. When using it you
      will attempt to write on your tile. Ghosts need to be either visible, or the
      cult must have reached the bloodstone phase. They will look for a blood splatter
      or footprint in an adjacent tile, if there are several they will get the option
      of which one to use, along with the source's color hex code. Humans however
      need blood on their hands or gloves and will use that one. You can preview your
      message before confirming like when using a crayon. There can be only one doodle
      per tile, and it carries DNA and color from the source blood. Also unlike the
      old bloody doodles, those are maptext'd, and can be read without being examined.
  - rscadd: Punching someone on a limb that is currently bleeding will splash their
      blood on your hands.
  - bugfix: Fixed dead mice still being able to nibble
  - tweak: Increased the layer at which remains appear. They appear now above tables
      but still below objects. As such they are no longer hidden by things like vents,
      scrubbers and pipe.
  - bugfix: When hitting someone with a weapon, should you miss the intended target
      limb and hit another limb, the chat will now correctly report which limb has
      been hit.
  - bugfix: Bomberman Spawns no longer invisible to ghosts who had darkness toggled
      off
  - bugfix: Bomberman Arenas no longer have their name in the corner set up incorrectly
      and showing up as literally just "name"
  - bugfix: Clothing in Bomerman Arenas  no longer remain on the ground after a round.
  - tweak: Reworked rag smothering to fix a few bugs. The new implementation requires
      you to target the rag at their mouth with a 1 second delay (a visible warning
      and SFX play as soon as an attempt is made). Species that do not breath cannot
      be smothered. People wearing smoke-blocking masks such as gas masks, internals,
      clown masks, surgical masks or cigarettes (if they're lit) cannot be smothered
      either. Upon success, all reagents inside the rag will be transferred inside
      the target (up to 5u).
  - bugfix: You no longer try to wipe down people that you are currently smothering
      or bandaging with a rag.
  - bugfix: You no longer try to wipe down the Sink when you fill up your rag.
  - tweak: Cultists now stop dancing while incapacitated, or when muted by holy water.
      This includes constructs when they are purged by a null rod.
  - bugfix: Cultists with the Chameleon gene no longer remain invisible while dancing.
  - rscadd: Cultists can now DANCE wherever using say "*cultdance". They will dance
      around the tile in front of them, so for the best looks do it in an open area.
      If other cultists uses the emote while adjacent to the first cultist's "dance
      center", they will join up and dance in sync. Up to 4 cultists may dance together
      without bumping into each other (as unlike the sacrifice/bloodstone dance, this
      one doesn't use forceMove)
  - tweak: You now need to be on help intent to reveal runes using a null rod. This
      means that you no longer get extra delay added to your attacks when using one
      to fight and missing by clicking the floor.
  - bugfix: Fixed mindless Wraiths appearing if you removed an amorphous mask that
      turns you into a Wraith when reaching the end of an Ethereal Jaunt.
  - experiment: Added a new Traitor Botanist uplink item, the Bee-Nade, which has
      been reworked to in fact spawn hornets that will immediately seek a target when
      they spawn. They also ignore the one who primed the spawner grenade, just like
      viscerators do. Cost 16 (Discount 8)
  - experiment: The Hornet Queen Packet traitor item has been replaced with a Deployable
      Wild Hornet Hive. Place it, throw it, drop it, but be careful as it cannot be
      picked up again once deployed. Those behave exactly like those from random events,
      except they spawn with less hornets inside, giving you a few seconds to get
      away before they start coming out. Cost 10 (Discount 5)
  - experiment: The swarm coming out of a Bee Briefcase now performs an attack as
      soon as it comes out of the briefcase, greatly increasing its lethal power.
      The TC cost has been slightly adjusted to match its increased lethality. Cost
      12 (Discout 6)
  - experiment: Bees and the likes now attack AFTER moving instead of before. This
      effectively increases their attack range, and so their dangerousness.
  - tweak: Bees that spawn from vermin infestations and hornets of all kind now immediately
      become angry again after their calmed status has expired instead of going back
      to their hive or to roaming.
  - rscadd: Bee and Hornet gatling guns bullets no longer deal direct damage, instead
      they immediately cause the spawned bug to attack once on impact. Said attack
      is also guaranteed to pierce bio or impermeable armors.
  - rscadd: Added a chillbug gatling gun. It doesn't deal damage of course but will
      inject 1u chillwax into players hit by the projectile.
  - rscadd: Added both the hornetgun and chillgun to Summon Guns.
  - bugfix: Bees and the likes can no longer attack through one-sided windows and
      windoors.
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to stomp snails when on harm intent.
  - bugfix: You can no longer convert the same mob several times (should they refuse
      and get restrained) to get additional progression on the Conversion objective.
  - tweak: Converting a mindless monkey (whether still monkey or human) will sacrifice
      them, leaving behind a coffer with a skull
  - bugfix: Space Heaters and Cult Forges can no longer heat up a room that's in a
      vacuum, causing mobs to take damage even though there is no molecules with which
      to exchange temperature.
  - bugfix: Fixed soul blades being offset both in the inventory and on the player
      when stored in the suit slot.
  - rscadd: All condiment bottles can have their content spilled over the floor if
      they are set to transfer 10 or more units. The amount spilled depends of the
      transferable amount set.
  - rscadd: Spilling 10 or more units of black pepper over the floor will create a
      cleanable mess.
  - imageadd: Tweaked the icons for salt piles and pepper mills.
  - rscadd: Added Holy Salts, a new reagent that can be easily produced by putting
      normal table salt in presence of a 5u catalyst of holy water. Just like salt,
      it will create cleanable piles when 10u of it are spilled over the floor.
  - rscadd: When salt piles are spawned, they now emit particles when they detect
      the presence of cult runes (even if concealed), talismans, tomes, and most other
      cult paraphernelia. After a set amount of time, the runes will be destroyed,
      the talismans and tomes will burn, and the other objects will break and melt
      away. The delay is 5 minutes for regular table salt, and 20 seconds for holy
      salts and starts when the pile is created.
  - rscadd: When a Path Entrance rune or a talisman attuned to a Path Exit rune is
      destroyed by a salt pile, a blood jaunt visible for a short duration will zoom
      toward the corresponding exit, giving the crew a hint as to the location of
      the Path Exit, and potentially a cult base. The jaunt will make a distinctive
      noise once it reaches the exit, letting any cultist near it at the time know
      that their base might be compromised.
  - rscadd: Added a couple more country flag-bearing mugs. Mug boxes such as those
      included in Cafe Equipment supply crates now include a random one each.
  - rscadd: Flag Mugs finally appear filled with liquid when some has been poured
      in them.
  - imageadd: Re-did the in-hand icons for mugs, and added some for all flag mugs.
      Mugs that contain a liquid that has a unique mug sprite no longer appear invisible
      in-hand, and instead use the default mug sprite.
  DrSnips:
  - bugfix: You can now use/work/hit windoors with basic tools again.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Adds plastic to the derelict MoMMI Material Synth.
  GreatBigFailure:
  - rscadd: Barbervends now sell scissors which allow actual barbering to take place.
  - rscadd: 4 new grey-specific rigsuits, 3 of which are available at cargo.
  - tweak: Egg cartons now have a small chance to come with a non-standard egg.
  Kurfursten:
  - rscadd: Hostile mobs are now able to break open firedoors and will fixate less
      on things they cannot reach.
  beesil:
  - rscadd: Adds red comfy chairs, standardizes comfy chair colors to match couches.
  kafovofa:
  - rscadd: Health analyzers highlight their heat reading in red if the target is
      too hot.
  kane-f:
  - bugfix: Ghosts no longer hide request console alerts
  - rscadd: All RCDs are now equipped with modules to transform compressed matter
      into windows and deconstruct them, unless made of plasma.
  - rscadd: Reagant dispensers, chemmaster derivatives, all-in-one grinders, microwaves,
      processors, seed extractors, biogenerators and xenobotany machines now work
      with conveyors.
  - rscadd: Mineral unloading machines are now buildable from circuit imprinters.
  - rscadd: Mineral unloading machines now have 3 matter bins and a capacitor, all
      upgradable for faster unloading and lower power usage.
  - rscadd: Mineral unloading machines can now have their directions tweaked with
      a multitool with ease.
  - rscadd: Mineral unloading machines work like conveyors on machines on the other
      end.
  - tweak: New common mineral machine item, cutting down a lot of redundant code and
      variables.
  - rscadd: Wizards have now learned Curse of the Hangman, a spell obscuring the letters
      in others' spoken words. Cure this by guessing the missing letters, but don't
      make mistakes, or it will reset!
  robintime:
  - spellcheck: punctuates several flavortexts
  - spellcheck: '''this the reinforced wall'' now just says ''the reinforced wall'''
2021-06-05:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed reagent splashing from beakers.
2021-06-06:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Egun beams now have their alpha reduced proportionally to their damage
      when they get dispersed by windows.
  - bugfix: beams no longer lag when firing through a large corridor or into space.
  - bugfix: Fixed full-tile windows not reducing beam damage. It now does it with
      the same efficiency as a single directional window.
  - bugfix: Firing beams straight through a tile featuring directional windows will
      no longer reduce its damage if the window isn't oriented toward (or away) from
      the source of the beam (which means that in most cases, if the beam crosses
      a tile with a window without intersecting with it, it shouldn't lose some of
      its damage)
  - bugfix: Fixed players losing space parallax upon turning into Shades.
  - bugfix: Fixed beams not going through windows facing the other way.
  - bugfix: Fixed beams dealing 0 damage never disappearing.
2021-06-07:
  Apogee-dev:
  - tweak: Makes replicator mommi's emagged eyes red
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Mature Space Vines (kudzu) will now properly spread when an adjacent door
      opens or an adjacent wall is dismantled.
  - bugfix: Fixed Biomass spreading through one-directional windows and firelocks.
  - bugfix: Fixed a very rare bug (actually I've calculated that it had a 4.5 percent
      chance of occurring which isn't THAT rare) where the Safe's tumblers were set
      in a way that prevented players from ever cracking the Safe open. But this time
      for real. No really, I've tested it with extreme values and all that.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Atmospheric Alert Computer appearing to be invisible when broken.
2021-06-08:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused challengers to spawn with no objectives if their
      target was the Trader.
  - rscadd: When cloned you now keep the default language you had when you were scanned.
2021-06-09:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added the white chicken suit I sprited back in 2015 and forgot to actually
      PR all this time. A single costume can be obtained from the AutoDrobe after
      inserting a coin.
  - imageadd: Improved the chicken suit and head in-hand icons.
  - rscadd: Humans have a few new emotes. ok/okay makes an OK sign, thumbup/thumbsup
      makes a thumbs up, thumbdown/thumbsdown makes a thumbs down, and peace makes
      a peace sign.
  - rscadd: Added hand count requirements for those emotes. Having your hands broken
      or amputated will make you unable to perform them.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - tweak: On the most foolish of days of the year, janitors lose their income, toiling
      for no monetary compensation.
2021-06-11:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: The scoreboard of the previous round can now be checked at any point by
      clicking the Last Round Information button that is now always available in the
      top right (until the current round ends)
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - rscadd: Adds a fully dysfunctional station for dorfmode events. Room for both
      chilling out in caves and building a functioning station. Includes a derelict
      ship mapped by BurntDevil.
2021-06-12:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed the right panel being much smaller than normal (hopefully)
  - bugfix: You can no longer write in blood as a ghost if the source blood disappeared
      before you finished writing your message.
  - bugfix: You can no longer write in blood if there is no blood left on your hands
      or glove by the time you finish writing your message.
  - tweak: Ghosts can now only write in blood up to a certain amount of tiles from
      the original blood source (before they could daisy-chain messages ad nauseam).
      The max distance depends of the original source's amount of blood. A drip will
      only have a radius of 1. Splatters a radius of 2. Gibs a radius of 5. (Same
      distance as footprints)
  - tweak: Projectiles now have a 75 percent chance of hitting mobs in cages, as long
      as the cover is up.
  - rscadd: Just like artificers can click floors up to 3 tiles away to convert them
      into cult floors, they can now click space tiles to conjure floors over them.
      As when done by clicking the spell button, conjuring a tile instead of converting
      one leads to a longer cooldown.
  - bugfix: Fixed mapped alien embryos not spawning a dead alien larva. Expect to
      find a few dead larvas hidden on some maps.
  - rscadd: All playable mobs now have standardized damage overlays which should help
      players controlling simple_animals noticing when they're taking damage.
  - bugfix: Fixed the brute and oxy damage overlays going away for a second then coming
      back when dying. Those overlays also now come back instantly when re-entering
      a corpse.
  - bugfix: Patched an exploit that allowed players to unload ore boxes using the
      pop-up window from any distance away or even adjacent but otherwise incapacitated,
      which apparently allowed a few people to mess with our shaft miner friends.
  - bugfix: Also fixed ore unloading machines causing all ore boxes in their area
      to dump everything every second, instead of only those in front of them.
  - experiment: Dynamic ruleset picking had its pseudo-RNG tweaked to now consider
      not just the previous round, but all 3 previous rounds, decreasing the odds
      of a ruleset being picked again in a short timespan. The odds are reduced more
      if the round was more recent, and if it fired several times in the previous
      three rounds the odd reductions will stack up. This should help prevent having
      the same ruleset firing several times in a short timespan.
  - experiment: Although note that rulesets that fire when the round was already about
      to end will NOT affect future rounds' ruleset weights.
  - experiment: Syndicate Traitors, both roundstart, latejoin, and midround, are also
      always exempt from this weight reduction.
  - experiment: Primetime rulesets now have lowered threat requirement, which should
      allow them to actually fire if the pop allows it but the Threat is average.
      Basically this means that Blob Tuesdays can finally be a thing. Also note that
      this doesn't affect low pop (if the threat requirement is 90, it will remain
      90 in most cases)
  - bugfix: The holomap on from the PDA Station Holomap app now properly updates when
      moving aboard a vehicle.
  - rscadd: The round end scoreboard now indicates which potions were bought by a
      wizard.
  - bugfix: Fixed scoreboard icons either missing or being wrong.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: Makes the mouser fit inside the handgun holster.
  Jackreturnswithaveangenace:
  - tweak: Fixed an exploitable thing and added dorf mommi spawners to dorf.
  kane-f:
  - tweak: Compressed matter implants now only store the activation emote in the memory
      of the implanter instead of the implanted, as with other traitor implants.
  - bugfix: RCDs can no longer be used on windows to remove mysterious invulnerable
      grilles.
2021-06-14:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Removed the random wall vent hidden under a sign at Packedstation's Chemistry
      lab.
  boy2mantwicethefam:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where player-controlled zombies could attack while double
      dead (given that zombies are already dead and when you shoot one enough it becomes
      double-dead, although this time two negatives don't turn into a positive)
  - rscadd: Added a new spell for the ancient spellbook, Card Trick! Guess what someone's
      card is and their inventory will completely fill up with the copies of the card!
  - bugfix: '"A card" not "card" description for playing cards.'
2021-06-15:
  DamianX:
  - tweak: Extended can no longer fire with fewer than 30 players.
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Cyborgs still being able to roll Challenger, again.
2021-06-16:
  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Fixed Delivery Chutes not activating if items where inserted via conveyor
      belts.
  - rscadd: Dorfstation now features a defective cloning pod among the other ancient
      cryogenic pods. Ghosts of players who died can click it at least 10 minutes
      after they died to respawn as if they came out of a cloning pod. However this
      means respawning with clone and brain damage, and a guaranteed genetic disability.
      Therefore you can decide for yourself whether to wait and preserve your identity,
      or respawn with a new identity from an ancient cryo pod. Alternatively, wait
      for the crew to set up medbay with a proper cloning pod.
  - rscadd: Added new mannequin types! Using either a marble (obtainable from cargo)
      or wooden (craftable) block, you can now sculpt a human woman, or a corgi. Said
      corgi mannequins can wear items just like real corgis do.
  - rscadd: Spessmen have gotten better at sculpting mannequins, and can now sculpt
      their hair and beards.
  - rscadd: Mannequins mobs, such as those that can be found on the drone ship, or
      created by wizards using a staff of animation on a mannequin, are now able to
      fire the guns in their hands, and benefit from the armor they are wearing.
  - tweak: Flesh to Stone now turns humans, vox, monkeys and corgi into marble mannequins
      instead of statues. This means that items can be attached on them or removed,
      but also that when hit by a bolt of animation, they will fight using the items
      in their hands and benefit from the armor that they are wearing.
  - tweak: Apetrine no longer kills or makes unclonable the mobs trapped in a statue
      if said statue was mostly undamaged (if the mob's HP were above 50 when they
      got trapped) although they will still take a fair bit of damage and might die
      shortly after if not given medical care.
  ShiftyRail:
  - tweak: You can now place mounted frames on top of full-tile windows or directional
      windows oriented in a way to support the light frame.

  - bugfix: Fixed Ore Unloaders not emptying ore boxes.

      down.
  - imageadd: Headcrab zombies have a new sprite looking more akin to their HL2 counterparts,

      than an actual headcrab, such as gold slimes or amorpheous masks.

  - rscadd: Traitor mimes can now purchase a spellbook teaching them how to conjure
      invisible un-walls. When active on a tile, mimes can cross over anything on
      it regardless of density.
2021-06-25:
  Apogee-dev:
  - rscadd: Crate & chest mimics can be wrapped and shipped over disposals.
  DeityLink:
  - experiment: Lowfat Bagel's Virology has underwent reconstruction. We're hoping
      you'll find the final product a little more functional.
  - rscadd: The critter cage in there also now actually features a pet lab mice instead
      of being desperately empty.
  - bugfix: Fixed humans not getting their hands bloody when punching people in their
      bleeding arms, legs, hands or feet.

  - experiment: Giant Spider vision has been reworked, fixing transparency issues
      among other things.
  - experiment: Catulism Syndrom (stage 3) now actually provides much improved vision
      in the dark. Tajarans also benefit from it by default. Incidentally, so can
      other human species should they have tajaran eyes implanted through surgery.
  - experiment: Mushroom people also see better in the dark by default, but not quite
      as good as Tajarans, however their genetic spell now lets them switch to a different

  DeityLink:
  - bugfix: Hobo shacks are now hidden on the minimap.

      admins while the toggle is off.
  - tweak: The Research Outposts airlocks on box, roid, and metaclub, all feature
      a second large dual-port vent, which should cut down by half the time it takes

      the agent who bought the belt as intended.

      randomly.
  - bugfix: Fixed Hex spawned by the Master Trainer Belt having invisible lights
  - bugfix: You no longer share contact diseases with someone after a punch or disarm
      that missed.
  - bugfix: Biting and Kicking can now properly transmit contact diseases, checking
      sterility on your feet instead of your hands in the case of kicking, and bypassing
      bleeding checks (and sterility checks on your own face) in the case of biting,
      which means that you can now bite people to transmit them your own (or get their)
      blood-only diseases (still needs to pass the sterility check on the target as
      well as the infection chance roll though). This applies to monkeys as well since
      they always attack by biting, but not to mice whose teeth aren't quite big enough.
  - bugfix: Fixed the borer development lab's airlocks being called borer devolopment.
  bathosbathtime:
  - rscadd: Bartenders and detectives no longer spawn with their inactive genetic

  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added wristwatches to the game, a new uniform accessory. Their hands move
      in real time on their sprite, and you can click it to get the current station
      time down to the second. Can be purchased from the merch computer at the Cargo
      Lobby.
  - rscadd: They can also extremely rarely be found from maintenance loot spawners,
      and tourists coming out of Ancient Cryopods have one equipped as a reference
      to the old long-time layering glitch that caused their right arm to appear to
      wear a red strap.
  - rscadd: Captains spawn with a unique golden wristwatch. Although there is a small
      chance of getting another one from the Vault's safe.
  - rscadd: There is also a sleek black variant that can be rarely found from maint
      spawners. Nuclear Operatives spawn equipped with those, as time is of the essence
      in their field.

      on the asteroid. Let your local xenoarchaeologist know if you're interested

      sprites.
  - rscadd: Added a new machine, the Photo Booth. Can be entered by just walking inside
      from the front, clicking it while inside will buckle you in there for a few
      seconds, then after a few seconds an ID photo will pop out of the machine. There
      will be at least one on each map, until then you can build them from R&D. You
      can also Alt Click the booth to select one of several backgrounds.
  - rscadd: ID Photo are a new subtype of photos. Just like regular photos you can
      write on them, use them on newscasters, but more importantly, when using them
      on a Security or Medical Records computer open on a given entry, you can scan
      the photo on the computer to update the entry's photo. Until now, new records
      created at a Security Computer were damned to never have any picture, this changes
      at last!
  - rscadd: Added scissors. They're basically just wirecutters with a different sprite.
      You can print them at an autolathe from the Misc Tools category. You can use
      them (or any type of wirecutter) on an ID photo to split it into 4 regular photos.
      Those individual photos CANNOT be used to update records.
  - bugfix: Fixed the same player being picked several times at once to be a wizard
      during Civil War of Casters, and ending up with more Spell Books at their disposal
      while other players get cucked out of their antag roll.

  - bugfix: Fixed the photo booth board appearing in the wrong category and printing
      a teleporter console board instead
  - bugfix: Mice (both observers and plague mice) will no longer spawn in the supermatter
      chamber, as well as in Virology or Xenobiology if their vents aren't connected
      to the rest of the station.
  - tweak: Getting disfigured now causes your hair and beard to no longer appear.
      Getting decapitated while disfigured causes the spawned head to be labelled
      as a disfigured head.
  - bugfix: When infected with several diseases all featuring the same symptoms that
      activate when touching or bumping into someone (namely Porokeratosis Acanthus
      and Epidermolysis Bullosa), only the first instance of each symptom type will
      activate per bump. So no more crit'ing people in a single bump while infected
      with 50 duplicates of the same disease, that symptom is deadly enough on its
      own already.
  gurfan:
  - rscadd: Centcomm Encryption Keys are now called Syndicate Encryption Keys in the
      Uplink Menu.
  - rscadd: The Syndicate Encryption Keys now grant access to the Syndicate radio

      doctor's delight a little easier

      really cold

      automatically
  - rscadd: Oil Slime Extract can be applied to any pickaxe or drill to make it mine
      in an AoE

      collectors and antimatter decelerators.

      Observers could also unbuckle mobs buckled inside coffins, and anyone could
      do it at any distance.
  - tweak: Buckling and Un-buckling from a coffin is now done via mouse-dragging,
      just like in a sleeper. AltClicking does nothing anymore, and clicking toggles
      normally the coffin open or closed. On that note, you can now properly close
      coffins while people are buckled in them.
  - bugfix: Fixed being unable to put cardboard in a microwave if there was only one
      sheet in the stack.
  Eneocho:
  - rscadd: Baby carp cubes and baby carp cube boxes, currently adminbus only.
  - rscadd: Carp Pheromone 30u bottles. Currently adminbus only.

  Apogee-dev:
  - rscadd: File cabinets, weight machines, and wooden cabinets can now be built out
      of 2 metal, 2 plasteel, and 2 wood respectively, and can be disassembled with
      a welder (file cabinet, weight machine) or a crowbar (cabinet).
  - rscadd: Secure cabinets can now be made by adding airlock electronics to a wooden
      cabinet.
  - tweak: While open, secure cabinets (detective, bar, wondrous wardrobe) can now
      be dismantled into wood and airlock electronics with a crowbar instead of welded
      into metal like a normal secure locker.
  - tweak: Weight machines can now be anchored and deanchored with a wrench.
  DamianX:
  - tweak: All job preferences have been reset because the way they are stored in
      the database has changed.

  DeityLink:
  - tweak: Substantially increased the chance for Wizarditis to spawn wizard clothing
      after the symptom has activated 60 times.
  - tweak: Also increased the chance for Wizarditis to cause spell casting from 3
      percent per activation to 20 percent.
  - tweak: Magnitis has been buffed quite a lot from the near-invisible symptom it
      was until now. The Symptom no longer has to pass two probability checks to activate
      instead of one. Its area of effect has also been increased by 1 tile for each
      three levels of intensity (which increases after the first 10 and 20 activations,
      to 3 tiles, to 6 tiles, to 9 tiles.)
  - experiment: A satellite has been observed drifting through Nanotrasen space which
      is believed to be the testing grounds of a new experimental type of AME. Whatever
      tests were done there appear to have stopped and the satellite was evacuated
      in a hurry. The satellite itself was deemed too unsafe to properly decommission
      so it is still drifting through space to this day. Regardless, do not go near
      it. Do not board it. And by all means Do Not try to resume the experiments that
      were happening there.
  - bugfix: Fixed NO_BLOOD human species still creating blood splatters when getting
      ZAS-slammed.
  - rscadd: The AME has gotten a bit of TLC, featuring new sounds, animations, a properly
      scaled UI that updates when interacted with, and the packaged reactor sections
      have gotten a new sprite and more importantly update the surrounding shield
      parts immediately after being deployed. The cores also emit a tiny bit of light
      when the AME is active. Finally the jars themselves now have in-hand icons,
      and feature a gauge on their side that displays how much fuel they have.
  - bugfix: Fixed blob meteors sometimes spawning adjacent duplicate blobs.
  - bugfix: Removed duplicate cables under Roidstation Engineering's SMES
  - tweak: Suiciding while holding one of the cyanide pills that Nuke Ops spawn with
      now instantly deals you all the damage that it would have done to you over time.
      That's 500 toxloss and 500 oxyloss, so basically an instant death without having
      to suicide AND succumb.
  - bugfix: Fixes examining people wearing accessories indicating "it has nothing"
      when there are in fact accessories
  - rscadd: Slimes processed inside a Slime Extractor now provide points to the crew
      score. The points provided remain constant regardless of the slime type, or
      whether it was on steroid.
  - tweak: Virology score for isolated antibodies has been substantially increased
      to account for the fact that each antibody can only be isolated once.
  - bugfix: Player-controlled Mice and Spiderlings are now prevented from spawning
      from vents on the Vox and Brig Outposts on RoidStation's main Station Z Level
      as those aren't connected to the rest of the main station's atmos.

2021-07-28:
  DamianX:
  - rscadd: The suit modification station can now repaint plasmaman and vox suits.
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added a new machine, the Data Disk Duplicator. Insert first a data disk
      of any type in the source slot, then insert a blank or corrupted disk in the
      target slot, and after a few second, the target disk will pop out as a carbon
      copy of the source disk, including the various datas that were on it. You can
      print its circuit board at RnD but it's also simple enough that you can also
      use a solding iron on a blank circuit board to craft it. Warranty void if emagged.
  - rscadd: You can now print blank data disks at an autolathe under Misc Items. Diskette
      Boxes bought on the Merch computer already also come with a random amount of
      corrupted disks that finally have a purpose.
  - bugfix: Fixed players walking into splatters despite being in a vehicle.
  - bugfix: Mobs affected by timestop now have their movement capabilities updated
      right as the timestop ends, fixing issues related to status effects being acquired
      during timestop.
  Eneocho:
  - tweak: Changed the Sacid recipe for proper stochiometry. In practice, you'll need
      double the oxygen to make any amount. This won't affect chem dispensers or any
      sacid-using recipe, only the ghetto-chem manufacture (or electrolysis) of Sacid.
  Kurfursten:
  - tweak: Packed voting requirements have been restored to 0 minimum and 10 maximum.

      now get an explicit message telling you to either double check the network ID
      or the range from the servers. (west3436)
  - tweak: Growth Dishes printed out of an Isolation Centrifuge now spawn offset south
      a bit so the centrifuge's light overlays don't hinder clicking on it. (Killette2)
  - tweak: Node and Core Blob Meteors now have some penetration, meaning they will
      land deeper inside the station, allowing for more interesting fights. When passing
      through obstacles they leave strong blobs, which prevent airflow and the surprise
      venting of areas. (ApogeeSys)
  - tweak: Solar Panels have had their penetration dampening value drastically reduced
      to match their fragility.
  - rscadd: The Blob HUD has been refreshed using the brand new UI datum system that
      we first implemented a few days ago. Beside the back-end changes, the new UI
      has a few new features. The useless Spawn Normal Blob button has been replaced
      with a toggle to restrain automatic expansion through walls. The gauge features
      small symbols that accurately indicate how many points you need to perform certain
      actions, and the Spawn Blob Core icon now tells you explicitly that you need
      to place more Nodes to be able to place more Cores when their cost is higher
      than your point cap. Lastly it also features a new look, with more easily readable
      numbers and graduations.
  - rscadd: When trying to place a special Blob too close from another blob of the
      same type, the game now tells you exactly how close you are from it.
  - rscadd: The right side of the Blob HUD now features two new buttons under the
      Health gauge. One is a shortcut for removing Blob tiles underneath you. The
      other opens a small Help panel listing some of the shortcuts. The gauge itself
      also features a smaller golden gauge on its side that tracks the progress to
      victory.
  - rscadd: Oh also Blob Overminds can now move diagonally.
  - imageadd: Special Blobs once again animate when they Pulse. For example Resource
      blobs emit a puff of purple smoke and Factory blobs play an animation when they
      spawn a Blob Spore.
  - soundadd: The Call Overminds blob power that allows other overminds to jump to
      your location now plays a sound to notify them more reliably.
  - bugfix: Fixed mindless Blob cores not using their cerebrate icon.

      158kb of 780 and sounding higher quality
  - tweak: Login music has been moved to its own folder and is iterated over when
      picking the login music, saving having to manually add any new tracks to the
      ticker pick list when updating these.
  - soundadd: Login music is more high quality on April 1st.

      the main station's.
2021-08-04:
  DeityLink:
  - rscadd: Added Photo Booths near the HoP offices on most maps. This allows HoPs
      to use their Security Records computer to update the crew's pictures, or add
      pictures to brand new records.
  - tweak: When manually expanding their blob, Overminds will spend only 5 points
      instead of 15 if the expansion didn't lead to a new blob getting created. This
      includes cases such as failing to expand over space, or trying and failing (often
      repeatedly) to break a wall/structure. (You still need 15 points to expand,
      but 10 points get reimbursed in case of failure)
  Eneocho:
  - spellcheck: Adds the missing period to the vending machines' vending messages.
      The "You hear a whirr" and "The [src.name] whirrs as it vends" ones.

      get damaged by heat regardless of if they're on or off, and can also be damaged
      by things like explosions, EMPs, and projectiles. Examining one when it is damaged
      informs you that a solder can be used to repair it. (gurfan)

      as well.
