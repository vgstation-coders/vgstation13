- rscadd: "Added a new away mission: 'The Hive'. A massive city-sized alien spaceship infamous for conquering hundreds of planets has entered high orbit above the station. Now is the perfect chance to send an elite strike team to put an end to its existence, and it looks like you're the best candidates for the job."
- rscadd: "Added 4 new enemy types for The Hive. Other than the away mission, they may sometimes spawn from golden slime cores."
