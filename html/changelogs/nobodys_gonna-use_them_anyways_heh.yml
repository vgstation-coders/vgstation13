delete-after: True

changes: 
- rscadd: "Added MOVE, EXPORT and LOCK buttons to assembly frames. MOVE lets you change the order in which assemblies are displayed. LOCK prevents you from accidentally ejecting assemblies from the frame. EXPORT saves the assembly frame's data to a sheet of paper (must have a blank piece of paper lying on the ground)."
- rscadd: "Inserting a sheet of paper with exported data into an empty assembly frame with all the required components on the same turf will instantly assemble and configure the frame!"
- rscadd: "Added new accessible values to comparison and write/read circuits."
- tweak: Comparison circuits can now work with text.
