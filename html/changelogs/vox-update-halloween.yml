changes:
- bugfix: Silences (, and .) no longer have crackling artifacts.  They also actually work now, under both voicepacks.
- bugfix: Return of the old HL VOX sound effects.  Will be re-recorded in the future so they sound more consistent.
- bugfix: Broke up lists into chunks so they stopped crashing the compiler.
- soundadd: Added bunch of new words, including pretty much every important chemistry reagent.
- sounddel: Removed a couple of broken phrases and orphaned/broken files.
- rscdel: Removed text announcement due to feedback. Can be re-added after poll or whatever fairly easily.
- rscadd: VOX sound lengths automatically generated by the standard SS13-VOX toolkit, eliminating the need for vox_sound_lengths.py.
- rscadd: Duration and size added to vox_data.json for third-party tool usage.
- tweak: Some pronunciation fixes.
- tweak: The HL sound effects have now been prefixed with _ so they're easier to find (bloop is now _bloop, etc).
- tweak: Words used by non-AI announcements are all standardized under a special announcer voice now.  Currently set to the default feminine voice, but may be changed in the future.
