# Example Changelog File
#
# Note: This file, and files beginning with ".", and files that don't end in ".yml" will not be read.  If you change this file, you will look really dumb.
#
# Your changelog will be merged with a master changelog. (New stuff added only, and only on the date entry for the day it was merged.)
# When it is, any changes listed below will disappear.
#
# Valid Prefixes: 
#   bugfix
#   wip (For works in progress)
#   tweak
#   soundadd
#   sounddel
#   rscdel (general adding of nice things)
#   rscadd (general deleting of nice things)
#   imageadd
#   imagedel
#   spellcheck (typo fixes)
#   experiment
#   tgs (TG-ported fixes?)
