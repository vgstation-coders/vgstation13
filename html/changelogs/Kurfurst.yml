changes: 
- tweak: A number of prehistoric plants have been changed so that they're more useful to botanists instead of being mere curiosities.
- tweak: Surik is now a source of Karmotrine
- tweak: Jurlmah is now a source of Clonexadone
- tweak: Amauri fruit has the curious NOREACT property and contains smoke
- tweak: Thaadra now contains only Frostoil and has the Altertemp mutation and startlingly high default potency
- tweak: Vale contains only Brawndo now
- tweak: Gelthi contains only nutriment now, but has the unusual harvest_repeat = 2 trait
- rscadd: Added a new trait, when harvest_repeat = 2, a plant will self-harvest itself.
- rscadd: Added many new alchohols mixed from Karmotrine, each with special effects.
- rscadd: Poison Wine is now a premium item at the Boozeomat instead of a product of Telriis.
- rscadd: Added a new sprite for harvested items missing sprites. You shouldn't ever have to see this, but at least it will be less confusing than the old sprite.
- rscadd: Brawndo now has what plants crave. Pour it into a tray and watch all the alerts go away!
- rscadd: New formula for Lemon Lime Soda, Lemon Juice + Lime Juice + Tonic
- rscadd: There is a 30% chance that while attempting to buy Starkist (an orange-flavored soda) that you will instead receive Lemon Lime. It's a conspiracy.
