changes: 
- rscadd: Added two new Vox plants to fill missing botanical niches, Slipping Pitchers and Aloe Vera
- rscadd: Added three new relevant recipes for plants.
- rscadd: Added Box (plural Boxen), freakish boar-like livestock for Vox to farm.
- rscadd: Added a Box Flesh Cloner, with which to clone fresh Box babies. Surely re-cloning the same meat again and again over untold generations won't cause the rise of some antediluvian horror.
- rscadd: Added Box meat, as well as three new pork-based recipes. Look at that bacon sizzle!
- tweak: Special thanks to all the spriters who contributed to the Vox hydroponics project, most prominently Inorien.
