 - experiment: Power output from radiation collectors now follows a combination of a logarithmic curve and the old linear equation. This means that you will get diminishing returns from radiation sources as pulse strength exceeds 100. In other words, SME gets nerfed, low level singulos get buffed, and max singulo output remains exactly the same. Values may be tweaked as needed, and revert may follow if this turns out to be an awful idea or something.
