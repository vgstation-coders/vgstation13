changes: 
- bugfix: "Fixed package wrap nullspacing things. (Actually fixed this several days ago but I didn't realize how long the bug had been happening so I didn't changelog it. Whoops!)"
- tweak: "Small wrapped packages now place the wrapped item in the same hand the package was in when opened."
