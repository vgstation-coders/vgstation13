			<h3 class="author">Iamgoofball updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes Morphine not knocking you out.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Hotline no longer exists. Poppies now have Saline-Glucose Solution.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Muriatic Acid, Caustic Soda, and Hydrogen Chloride have been removed, along with the secondary meth recipe. The original recipe still works.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Foam now produces more bang for your buck when mixed. Your foam grenades should be larger now to account for the slowdown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Stabilizing Agent. This chemical will prevent the effects of certain reactions from taking place in  the container it is in, such as Smoke Powder and Flash Powder, allowing you to get the raw forms of the powders for heating up later.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Smoke Powder and Flash Powder can now be mixed along with Stabilizing Agent in order to produce a powder version of the effects. You can then heat these powders to 374K to get the effects.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mixing them without Stabilizing Agent gives the default effects.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Sonic Powder, a chemical that deafens and stuns within 5 tiles of the reaction. It also follows the reaction rules of the other 2 powders.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Liquid Dark Matter and Sorium also now work like the powders do.</li>
				<li class="tweak">CLF3 now has a higher chance of making plating tiles, and the burn damage caused by it scales based on your fire stacks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Pyrosium. This reagent heats up mobs by 30 degrees every 3 seconds if it has oxygen to react with. Useful for when you want a delayed mix inside of someone.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Cryostylane.  This reagent does the opposite of Pyrosium, but it still requires oxygen to react with.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Phlogiston. This reagent ignites you and gives you a single fire stack every 3 seconds. Burn damage from this chemical scales up with the fire stacks you have. Counter this with literally any chemical that purges other chems.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Smoke now transfers reagents to the mob, and applies touch reactions on them. This means smoke can run out of reagents, no more infinite acid smoke. It also only works on mobs, use the new Reagent Foam(tm) for your hellfoam needs. I suggest a CLF3 Fluoroacid Black Powder mix.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Added a derelict medibot to the code, will place a few on the derelict when this PR is merged as to prevent mapping conflicts.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Initropidril. 33% chance to hit with 5-25 TOX damage every 3 seconds, and a 5-10% chance to either stun, cause lots of oxygen damage, or cause your heart to stop. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Pancuronium. Paralyses you after 30 seconds, with a 7% chance to cause 3-5 loss of breath. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Sodium Thiopental. Knocks you out after 30 seconds, and destroys your stamina. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Sulfonal. +1 TOX per 3 seconds, knocks you out in 66 seconds. Mix it with Acetone, Diethylamine, and Sulfur.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Amantin. On the last second it is in you, it hits you with a stack of TOX damage based on how long it's been in you. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Lipolicide. +1 TOX unless you have nutriment in you. Mix it with Mercury, Diethylamine, and Ephedrine.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Coiine. +2 TOX and +5 loss of breath every 3 seconds. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Curare. +1 TOX, +1 OXY, paralyzes after 33 seconds. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds a reagent_deleted() proc to reagents for effects upon the last time it processes in you, like with Amantin.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Neurotoxin required temperature for mixing has been set to 674K, it was 370K for some reason.</li>

Eating food with vitamin (new reagent) counteracts the sugar effects and can give you temporary buffs when well fed: it lowers your chance to catch or spread viruses,it makes your body's metabolism more efficient that is it keeps healing reagents longer and evacuate toxins faster and reduces damage from radioactive reagents.

				<li class="rscadd">After the years of extensive research into xenobiology, and thousands of scientists lost to the slimes, we have finally come to admitting that we don't have a clue how they work. However, we've outlined a few facts, and managed to breed a new kind of slimes. They will be shipped to your station on the next shifts. They are different from the ones they are used to in the following:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Their sight is better than ever, and now they can finally see things that are not directly pressed against them. Beware, they may appear more aggressive!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Their memory has also become better, and they will now remember the people who fed them. As a note, you need to grab the monkey or push it to show to the slime that you're giving it to them, and it's not just walking in.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Apparently, not only we have studied them, but they have also studied us. Slimes are now capable of showing various emotions, mimicking humans. Use it to your advantage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There are reports of slimes showing signs of sentience. Further research is recommended.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">One of the reported signs is their speech capability. Following facts have been gathered: they talk more often to those who feed them; they react to being called by the number, but 'slimes' is also acceptable; they are able to understand being ordered to "follow" someone, or "stop". There is a report of slime releasing the assistant after a scientist shouted at it, and then calmly ordered a slime to stop.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">We've made a modification of a health scanner that is intended for the use on slimes. Two are available in the smartfridge.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Constructable machines now depend on R&amp;D; parts!</li>
		<li class="rscadd">DNA scanner: Laser quality lessens irradiation. Manipulator quality drastically improves precision (9x for best part) and scanner quality allows you to scan suicides/ling husks, with the best part enabling the cloner's autoprocess button, making it scan people in the scanner automatically.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Clone pod: Manipulator quality improves the speed of cloning. Scanning module quality affects with how much health people will be ejected, will they get negative mutation/no mutations/clean of all mutations/random good mutation, at best quality will enable clone console's autoprocess button and will try to clone all the dead people in records automatically, together with best DNA scanner parts cloning console will be able to work in full automatic regime autoscanning people and autocloning them.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Borg recharger: Capacitors' quality and powercell max charge affect the speed at which borgs recharge. Manipulator quality allows borg to be slowly repaired while inside the recharges, best manipulator allows even fire damage to be slowly repaired.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Portable power generators: Capacitors' quality produce more power. Better lasers consume less fuel and reduce heat production PACMAN with best parts can keep whole station powered with about sheet of plamsa per minute (approximately, wasn't potent enough to test).</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Autolathe: Better manipulator reduces the production time and lowers the cost of things(they will also have less m_amt and g_amt to prevent production of infinity metal), stacks' cant be reduced in cost, because thatll make production of infinity metal/glass easy</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Protolathe: Manipulators quality affects the cost of things(they will also have less m_amt and g_amt to prevent production of infinity metal), best manipulators reduces the cost 5 times (!)</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Circuit imprinter: Manipulator quality affects the cost, best manipulator reduce cost(acid insluded) 4 times, i.e. 20 boards per 100 units of acid</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Destructive analyzer: Better parts allow items with less reliability in. Redone how reliability is handled, you now see item reliability in the deconstruction menu and deconstructing items that has same or one point less research type level will rise the reliability of all known designs that has one or more research type requirements as the deconstructed item. Designs of the same type raise in reliability more. Critically broken things rise reliability of the design drastically. Whole reliability system is not used a lot but now at least on the R&amp;D; part it finally matters.</li>

		Unstable anomalies have been spotted in your region of space. These anomalies can be hazardous and destructive, though our initial encounters with these space oddities has discovered a method of neutralization. Method follows.<br>
		<p>Step 1. Upon confirmation of an anomaly sighting, report its location. Early detection is key.<br>
		Step 2. Using an atmospheric analyzer at short range, determine the frequency that the anomaly's core is fluctuating at.</br>
		Step 3. Send a signal through the frequency using a radio signaller. Note that non-specialized signaller devices may possibly lack the frequency range needed.<br></p>
		With the anomaly neutralized and the station brought out of danger, inspect the area for any remnants of the anomaly. Properly researched, we believe these events could provide vast amounts of valuable data.<br>

		<li class='rscadd'>We at Nanotrasen would like to assure you that we know the pain of waiting five minutes for the emergency shuttle to be dispatched in a high-alert situation due to our confirmation-of-distress policy. Therefore, we have amended our confirmation-of-distress policy so that, in the event of a red alert, the distress confirmation period is shortened to three minutes and we will hurry in preparing the shuttle for transit. This totals to 6 minutes, in hope that it will give our <b>very expensive equipment</b> a better chance of recovery.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Simplified detective stuff. The high-res scanner is gone and instead the detective's normal scanner will instantly report all fingerprints, dna and cloth fibers in full. This was needed because the system took too long to work with and disencouraged detectives. Not only that, it made detectives less of a threat for antagonists and made possible scenerios, such as framing someone by changing fingerprints with someone else, impratical. To replace the computer, the detective will have a full medical computer with access to it. Not only that, but his useless filing cabinet will be replaced with an empty one for serious investigators. Along with this, are fingerprint cards and built-in PDA scanning, as all of security had access to it which was really the detective's thing. The new scanner will also log every finding and you can print them out as a report by clicking the scanner while it is in your active hand.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">You can toggle the pressure of your sprayer by clicking on it while it is in your active hand. With pressure, the sprayer will spray 10 units on the floor, otherwise it sprays 5. You'll need to turn pressure on to spray water on the floor and make it slippery.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">AIs in intellicards can no longer move their camera. This will limit them in ability but without making creating and carding an AI to have as a personel door opener impossible.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Telecommunication Busses can now be set to change the frequency of a signal. (Allowing you to say.. set the command channel to broadcast to the common channel).</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Telecommunication was changed to be more effecient. Because of this, Relays don't need a broadcaster or a receiver and you can setup a relay on it's own. You can still disable sending and or receiving from the relay's interface.</li>

		Lots of changes. This is just a brief summary of the most recent changes; still working on proper documentation.<br>
		All admins have access to view-vars, player-panel(for individual mobs), game panel and secrets panel. Most of the things on those pages have their own rights requirements. For instance, you can only use event orientated secrets in the secret panel if you have FUN rights. Debug secrets if you have DEBUG rights. etc.<br>
		Spawn xeno and toggle gravity procs were moved into the secrets panel (fun).<br>
		<a href='http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/source/browse/trunk/config/admin_ranks.txt'>This</a> may help with understanding which flags do what. Unfortuanately it's still somewhat vague.<br>

		<li class="rscadd">-Changes flour from an item to a container-held reagent. All recipes have been updated to use 5 units of reagent flour for every item required previously.   This has a few advantages: The 16(!) sacks of flour previously in the kitchen cabinet have been condensed to an equivalent 3 sacks. Beer is now brewable with universal enzyme, and converting lots of wheat into flour should be less tedious. Also, flour grenades, etc.  Because of this, flour is now obtained from the all-in-one blender rather than the processor, and spaghetti noodles are made with 5 units of flour in the microwave.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Added the Light Replacer. This is a device that can auto replace lights that are broken, missing or burnt. Currently it is found in the Janitor's closet and Janitor Borgs can equip it. You can refill it with glass, or if you're a Cyborg, just recharge. It is emaggable and will replace lights with rigged lights. The light's explosion was nerfed to help balance it and it is very noticable when you are holding an emagged Light Replacer.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Alien hunters will now cloak when using the 'stalk' movement intent. Whilst cloaked they will use up their plasma reserves. They can however cloak as long as they like. Using the Lay-down verb will allow them to remain cloaked without depleting their plasma reserves,  hence allowing them to lay ambushes for unsuspecting prey. Should a hunter attack anybody, or get knocked down in any way,  they will become visible. Hopefully this allows for more strategic/stealthy gameplay from aliens. On the other hand, I may have totally  screwed the balance so feedback/other-ideas are welcome.</li>

The systems replaced were causing immense performance issues so the following are very necessary optimisations.<br>However, there is a downside: SS13 code is the equivilant of monkeys on typewriters. Despite weeks of constant coding/testing there -will- be things I've missed. The kinds of bugs I'm expecting are overlays not updating and/or in rare cases things not appearing in your hud. Most of these issues can be worked around simply by dropping the item and picking it back up. If all else fails ask an admin to regenerate your icons through view-vars.<br><u>Please</u> report any bugs to me on <b>#coderbus IRC</b> or <b>make an issue on the tracker</b> as a matter of urgency. I will fix them ASAP.<br>Also a massive thankyou to Nodrak, Erro, Pete and Willox. :)</font></li>

This <b>had</b> to be removed, there is work on a more fitting system, but this had to be taken out first regardless, and the longer people beat around the bush the worse the situation got.</li>
		<li>The gun change was made for no real reason and was pretty problematic, so reverting that should mean there are a lot less 'accidental suicides.'</li>

                <BR><BR>How they're used: Unfold the rolled poster on any wall or r_wall to create the poster. There are currently 17 designs, with the possibility of me adding more.
                <BR><BR>How to get rid of them: You can rip them using your hand... To cleanly extract them and not ruin them for future use, however, you can use a pair of wirecutters.
                <BR><BR>How they're classified: They're contraband, so it's perfectly okay for security officers to confiscate them. Punishment for contraband-providers (or end-users, if you want to go full nazi) is up to the situational commanding officers.

The round does not end until the shutle comes to a stop and docks. Don't step outside while the shuttle is moving!<br><br>For example; if you are a traitor and have an escape-alone objective and a couple of people manage to squeeze in the shuttle, you have two minutes to kill/toss them out to win.

  <ul>	
	<li><font face="terminal"><b>UPDATE ON THE UPDATE</b>: Newspapers are now fully working, sorry for that. Some minor icon bugs fixed. Now I'm free to work on the contest prizes :3</FONT></li>
	<li><b><font color="red">Newscasters are now LIVE!</font></b> Bug reports, suggestions for extra uses, tears etc go <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/source/detail?r=3005" target='_blank'>here</a>.</li>
	<li>What <b>ARE</b> newscasters? Fans of the Transmetropolitan series might find them familiar. Basically, they're terminals connected to a station-wide news network. Users are able to submit channels of their own (one per identified user, with channels allowing feed stories by other people or, if you want the channel to be your very own SpaceJournal, being submit-locked to you), while others are able to read the channels, either through the terminals or a printed newspaper which contains every news-story circulating at the time of printing.</li>
	<li>About censorship: You can censor channels and feed stories through Security casters, found in the HoS'es office and the Bridge. Alternatively, if you want a channel to stop operating completely, you can mark it with a D-Notice which will freeze it and make all its messages unreadable for the duration it is in effect. If you've got the access, of course.</li>
	<li>Basically I think of the newscaster as nothing more as an additional Roleplaying tool. Grab a newspaper along with your donuts and coffee from the machines, read station rumors when you're manning your desk, be a station adventurer or journalist with your very own network journal!</li>
	<li>I would ask for a bit of respect when using the machine, though. I removed all and any channel and story restrictions regarding content, so you might end up seeing channels that violate the rules, Report those to the admins.</li>
	<li>Finally, due to the removal of the enforced "Channel" string, it's recommended to name your channels properly ("Station Paranormal Activity Channel" instead of "Station Paranormal Activity", for example")

		<li>A sneaky yordle can also hide in it, if he so desires, or hack it, or lock it or do a plethora of shady stuff with it. Beware, though, there's plenty of dangerous things you can do with it, both to you and your target.</li>
		<li>The Unit's control panel can be accessed by screwdriving it. That's all I'm willing to say, I'd like to let the players find out what each hack option does and doesn't. Will add more stuff later.</li>
		<li>Added Command Space suit, Chief Engineer space suit and Chief Medical Officer spacesuit (In a new space that you'll probably notice by yourself) to make it easier for you to look like a special snowflake.</li>
		<li>EVA and CMO office modified to accomodate the new suits and SSUs. Look, I'm not a competent mapper, okay? Fuck you too. A mapper is strongly recommended to rearrange my half assed shit.</li>
		<li>Soda cans, cigarette packets, cigarettes and cigars as well as bullet casings are now considered trash and can be picked up by the trashbag. Now you can annoy the janitor even more!</li>

	<ul>
		<li><font color='red'>Cult updates:</font></li>
		<li><b>New rune!</b> Stun rune. When used as rune, briefly stuns everyone around (including cultists). When imbued into a talisman, hit someone to stun and briefly mute them. Spawnable with the starter talisman.</li>
		<li>Imbue rune doesnt disappear after succesful invocation, only the source rune.</li>
		<li>Chaplain's bible now has 20% chance to convert a cultist (was 10%), and gives a message on success.</li>

		<li>Beginning of armor overhaul. Armor now has slightly better defence against melee, and weaker against shots. More coming soon...someday</li>
		<li>Cyborgs finally drop their MMI when gibbed like they were supposed to back when I added MMIs. Round- start cyborgs use whatever name you have selected for your character for the brain that gets spawned for them.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li><b>Darem updated:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Chemistry update</li>
		<li>In containers where there isn't a perfect ratio of reagents, reactions won't consume ALL of the related reagents (so if you mix 10 anti-toxin with 20 inaprovaline, you get 10 tricordrazine and 10 inaprovaline rather then just 10 tricodrazine)</li>
		<li><font color='red'>Catalysts</font>: some reactions might need presence of an element, while not directly consuming it.</li>
		<li>Reactions changed to use catalysts: all recipes that require Universal Enzyme now require 5 units of the enzyme but the enzyme isn't consumed (So Tofu, Cheese, Moonshine, Wine, Vodka, and Kahlua recipes). 
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Errorage updated:</b>

		<li><font color='red'>Smooth tables</font>: Tables now automatically determine which direction and sprite they'll use. They will connect to any adjacent table unless there is a window between them (regular, reinforced, tinted, whichever)</li>

<ul>
	<li><b><font color='red'>DANGERCON UPDATE:</font><font color='blue'>Agouri and Erro updated(I'm in the DangerCon team now, nyoro~n :3):</font></b>
	<ul>
		<li>Backpacks removed from all players. It was unrealistic. You can now had to the living quarters to get one from the personal closets there.</li>
		<li>Any firearms now send you to critical in 1-2 shots. Doctors need to get the wounded man to surgery to provide good treatment. Guide for bullet removal is up on the wiki.</li>
		<li>Brute packs and kelotane removed altogether to encourage use of surgery for heavy injury.</li>
		<li>Just kidding</li>
		<li>Fireaxe cabinets and Extinguisher wall-mounted closets now added around the station, thank Nanotransen for that.</li>
		<li>Because of Nanotransen being Nanotransen, the fire cabinets are electrically operated. AIs can lock them and you can hack them if you want the precious axe inside and it's locked. The axe itself uses an experimental two-handed system, so while it's <u><font color='red'>FUCKING ROBUST</u></font> you need to wield it to fully unlock its capabilities. Pick up axe and click it in your hand to wield it, click it again or drop to unwield and carry it.You can also use it as a crowbar for cranking doors and firedoors open when wielded, utilising the lever on the back of the blade. And I didn't lie to you. It's fucking robust.</li>
		<li>Fireaxe, when wielded, fully takes up your other hand as well. You can't switch hands and the fireaxe itself is unwieldy and won't fit anywhere. 
		<li>A fireaxe cabinet can also be smashed if you've got a strong enough object in your hand.<li>
		<li><b>EXTINGUISHER CLOSETS</b>, made by dear Erro, can be found in abundance around the station. Click once to open them, again to retrieve the extinguisher, attack with extinguisher to place it back. Limited uses, but we've got plans for our little friend.
		<li><font color ='blue'><u>Sprite kudos go to: Cheridan for most of them, Khodoque for the fantastic fireaxe head. I merged those two. Also thanks to matty and Arcalane for giving it a shot.</font></u></li>
		<li><font size = '2'><i>Has the piano got TOO annoying? Try the fire axe...</font size></i></li>
		<li>Oh, and tou can now construct Light floors! To do it: Use wires on glass, then metal on the produced assembly, then place it on an uncovered floor like you would when replacing broken floor tiles. To deconstruct: Crowbar on light floor, use crowbar on produced assembly to remove metal, wirecutters to seperate the wires from the glass. Sprites by delicious <font color ='blue'>Hempuli.</font></li>
		<li>Got something to bitch about? Got a bug to report? Want to create drama? Did the clown destroy your piano while you were playing an amazing space remix of the moonlight sonata? Give it <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/source/detail?r=1543">here</a>

	<LI>The amount of power the station uses should be lower.
	<LI>The singularity now changes size based upon how much energy it has
	<LI>New Machine: Particle Accelerator.
	<LI>It might need a better name/sprite but when put together properly and turned on it will shoot Accelerated Particles.

	<LI>New layout for Engineering, might be changed up slightly in the next few days.

<h5>06.02.2011, r979</h5>
<ul>
	<LI>Jesus christ it's a new map what the fuck
	<LI>Just kidding, it's only minor changes to medbay/mechbay/cybernetics/R&amp;D/toxins/robotics/chapel/theatre
	<LI>Okay so there's too many changes to list completely, but basically: toxins/R&amp;D/virology/xenobiology are south <i>through</i> medbay; robotics/cybernetics/mechbay are where toxins used to be, the theatre and chapel are above medbay.
	<LI>Theatre is a new place for the Clown and Mime to play, there are some costumes available, a stage and backstage, and seating for the audience.
	<LI>R&amp;D and Toxins have been combined together. R&amp;D is still work in progress. You need to head south through medbay to get there.
	<LI>Medbay has been re-arranged slightly. Honestly, it's nothing, I bet you won't even notice anything different. There's also a new surgery suite, complete with pre-op and post-op rooms. 
	<LI>Virology's been rearranged, but it is mostly in the same place still.
	<LI>Xenobiology is work in progress. [There's some fun stuff still being coded]
	<LI>The Chapel is now to the north. You'll probably be thinking something like "Goddamn, this place is fucking huge", but it's actually smaller than the previous chapel.
	<LI>Robotics and related stuff is also work in progress - however, everything needed for making borgs is there. Note: de-braining will now be done by surgeons in medbay, rather than roboticists in robotics, in case you're wondering where your optable went.
	<LI>I added color-coded pipes in the areas I was working on. Red pipes run from air siphons and feed into the waste loop; blue pipes run from air vents and pump whatever atmos is set to pump. Yeah, there's TWO pipe networks on the station, who knew? Well, some of you probably did, but I didn't!
	<LI>Please bring all complaints/ideas/suggestions/bugfixes to: <a href="http://tgstation13.servehttp.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=14971#p14971">This awesome thread on our forums</a>

	<LI>Mining system nearing completion.
	<LI>Massive overhaul to the electricity systems, the way singularity makes power, and various related functions.
	<LI>Mime spawns with White Gloves instead of Latex Gloves (apparently there's a difference!)
	<LI>A new event has been- CLANG! What the fuck was that?
	<LI>Ion storm laws should be much more interesting.
	<LI>Security reports should no longer list traitor heads/AIs as possible revs/cultists, nor should nuke operatives ever get named for anything.
	<LI>Pens are much more versatile and user friendly.
	<LI>Mech building is rapidly on its way! Ripleys can be built, consult your quartermasters.
	<LI>Traitors now have several new things they can steal.
	<LI>Some surgeries coded to accompany the new operating room and surgery tools.
	<LI>Research and Design is continuing development and should be rolled out shortly.
	<LI>Various sprites added, tweaked, scrapped and fixed.

<h5>14.01.2011, r853</h5>
<ul>
	<LI>Changlings Overhauled. Now function kinda like alium (using an internal chemical reserve instead of plasma) with each ability requiring a certain amount of chemicals to activate. Both venoms removed. Several "Dart" abiliites added. They allow the changling to deafen, blind, mute, paralyze, or even transform (dead) targets.
	<LI>Carp meat now contaminated with Carpotoxin. Anti-toxin negates the poison, however.

	<LI>Carded AIs no longer take damage while in unpowered areas.
	<LI>Chaplains can now name their religion at round start.
	<LI>New Recipies: Clown Burger (1 Clown wig, 5 flour), Mime Burger (1 beret, 5 flour), Cuban Carp (1 carp fillet, 1 chili, 5 flour).
	<LI>Napalm nerfed a bit. Produces ~25% less plasma but it's all concentrated in a single tile (will still spread, though).
	<LI>Reagent bottles can, once again, be put into grenades.
	<LI>Various minor map changes.
</ul>

<h5>08.01.2011,8:00PST, r820</h5>

	<LI>Pre-spawned pills no longer have randomized image.
	<LI>Bridge reorganized.

	<LI>Meat Crate added to QM.
	<LI>Corn can now be blended in a blender to produce corn oil which is used to create glycern.
	<LI>Request Consoles added across the station. Can be used to request things from departments (and slightly easier to notice then the radio).
	<LI>Centcom reoragnized a fair bit. Not that players care but admins might enjoy it.
	<LI>There is now a toggable verb that changes whether you'll turn into an alium or not.
	<LI>Hair sprited modified.
	<LI>Napalm and Incendiary Grenades both work now. Have fun setting things on fire.
	<LI>Binary Translater traitor item added. It allows traitors to hear the AI (it functions like a headset).
	<LI>New Disease: Pierrot's Throat. Enjoy, HONK!
	<LI>Robotic Transformation (from Robrugers) and Xenomorph Transformation (from xenoburgers) now curable.
	<LI>Mining added. Only accessible by admins (and those sent by admins). Very much WIP.
	<LI>Alium Overhaul. Divided into multiple castes with distinct abilities.
	<LI>New AI Modules: The goody two-shoes P.A.L.A.D.I.N. module and it's evil twin T.Y.R.A.N.T. Only the former actually spawns on the station.
	<LI>Lizards added. They run away and shit.
	<LI>PDA overhaul. Doesn't change anything for humans, just makes coders happy.
	<LI>Firesuits redone to look less like pajamas and instead like firesuits. Fire lockers also added.

	<LI>Circuit Imprinter: Using disks from the various deparments, new circuit boards and AI modules can be produced.
	<LI>Heat Exchanging pipes added and various pipe/atmos changes.
	<LI>Ghost/Observer teleport now works 100% of the time.

<h5>17.12.2010,11:00GMT</h5>
<ul>
	<LI>You need an agressive grip to table now, as well as being within one tile of the table (to nerf teletabling).</li>
	<LI>Teleport only runs once at the beginning of the round, hopefully reducing the lag in wizard rounds.</li>
	<LI>Wizards can't telepot back to their shuttle to afk now.</li>
	<LI>Someone added it a while ago and forgot to update the changelog - syndies in nuke need to move their shuttle to the station's zlevel first.</li>
	<li>Bunch of other stuff.</li>
