/*
	Adjacency proc for determining touch range

	This is mostly to determine if a user can enter a square for the purposes of touching something.
	Examples include reaching a square diagonally or reaching something on the other side of a glass window.

	This is calculated by looking for border items, or in the case of clicking diagonally from yourself, dense items.
	This proc will NOT notice if you are trying to attack a window on the other side of a dense object in its turf.  There is a window helper for that.

	Note that in all cases the neighbor is handled simply; this is usually the user's mob, in which case it is up to you
	to check that the mob is not inside of something
