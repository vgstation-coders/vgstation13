/mob/proc/throw_alert(category, type, severity, obj/new_master, override = FALSE)

/* Proc to create or update an alert. Returns the alert if the alert is new or updated, 0 if it was thrown already
 category is a text string. Each mob may only have one alert per category; the previous one will be replaced
 path is a type path of the actual alert type to throw
 severity is an optional number that will be placed at the end of the icon_state for this alert
 For example, high pressure's icon_state is "highpressure" and can be serverity 1 or 2 to get "highpressure1" or "highpressure2"
 new_master is optional and sets the alert's icon state to "template" in the ui_style icons with the master as an overlay.
 Clicks are forwarded to master
 Override makes it so the alert is not replaced until cleared by a clear_alert with clear_override, and it's used for hallucinations.
