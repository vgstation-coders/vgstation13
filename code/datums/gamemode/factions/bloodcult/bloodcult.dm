//CULT_ACT_I		Altar raised. cultists can now convert.
//CULT_ACT_II		Cultist amount reached. cultists are now looking for the sacrifice
//CULT_ACT_III		Sacrifice complete. cult is now going loud, spreading blood and protecting bloodstones while the crew tries to destroy them
//CULT_ACT_IV		Bloodspill threshold reached. bloodstones become indestructible, rift opens above one of them. cultists must open it, crew must close it.
//CULT_EPILOGUE		The cult succeeded. The station is no longer reachable from space or through teleportation, and is now part of hell. Nar-Sie hunts the survivors.
//CULT_MENDED		The cult failed (bloodstones all destroyed or rift closed). cult magic permanently disabled, living cultists progressively die by themselves.

//When cultists need to pay in blood to use their spells, they have a few options at their disposal:
// * If their hands are bloody, they can use the few units of blood on them.
// * If there is a blood splatter on the ground that still has a certain amount of fresh blood in it, they can use that?
// * If they are grabbing another person, they can stab their nails in their vessels to draw some blood from them
// * If they are standing above a bleeding person, they can dip their fingers into their wounds.
// * If they are holding a container that has blood in it (such as a beaker or a blood pack), they can pour/squeeze blood from them
// * If they are standing above a container that has blood in it, they can dip their fingers into them
// * Finally if there are no alternative blood sources, you can always use your own blood.
