		inside an arcane tome however most talismans are weaker than the rune they're imbued from. Exceptions exist, as the Stun rune which becomes much more potent when used directly in contact with a target. \
		Other exceptions are the Door, Portal Entrance, and Conversion runes which will be attuned with the talisman instead of absorbed, allowing them to be triggered remotely, and also \
		the Portal Exit rune, which can be used to immediately jaunt toward the Exit it was attuned to. One last use for this rune, is a ritual allowing a talisman to be transmitted directly \
