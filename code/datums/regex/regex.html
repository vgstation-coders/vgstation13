<h2>Using Regex</h2>

<p>To use regular expressions, first you have to compile the pattern you will
use to search or replace. To do this you create a new <tt>/regex</tt>
datum.</p>

<pre>var/regex/R = new("/time/")</pre>

<p>This will create a new regular expression which searches for the word
"time" in lowercase. With this expression you can use <tt>Find()</tt> to
find "time" and <tt>FindNext()</tt> to keep searching.</p>

<p>If the expression fails to compile, the <tt>error</tt> var will tell you
the reason why. Always check <tt>error</tt> before searching the
expression.</p>

<p>The <tt>/</tt> character is a <b>delimiter</b> which says where the
pattern begins and ends, which is important for later examples. You can use
almost any character as a delimiter. If you want to use that same character
in the pattern, you must escape it with a backslash; in a BYOND string,
you'll need to use <tt>\\</tt> for that.</p>

<pre>var/txt = "It's time to start the timer."
if(R.Find(txt))
  do
    world &lt;&lt; "[copytext(txt,1,R.match)]\
              &lt;b&gt;[copytext(txt,R.match,R.index)]&lt;/b&gt;\
              [copytext(txt,R.index)]"
  while(R.FindNext(txt))</pre>

<blockquote><b>Result:</b><br />
It's <b>time</b> to start the timer.<br />
It's time to start the <b>time</b>r.</blockquote>

<p>If you had chosen <tt>/\btime\b/</tt> as a pattern instead, "time" would
only be found as a whole word, so the second line would not appear.</p>

<pre>var/regex/R = new("/\\btime\\b/")</pre>

<p>Since this is written in DM, where a backslash has special meaning, it's
important when you use backslashes to escape them with another backslash so
BYOND can read them. Likewise if you use brackets <tt>[...]</tt> you'll have
to use <tt>\[</tt> as well.</p>

<h3>Replacing text</h3>

<p>Replacement is about as easy as searching. Create a find-and-replace
pattern and use <tt>Replace()</tt> to perform the replacement.
<tt>Replace()</tt> returns the changed text if it does anything, and null
if the pattern was not found.</p>

<pre>var/regex/R = new("/\\bred\\b/blue/")
var/txt = "Fred threw the red ball to Jane. Jane caught the red ball."
var/newtxt = R.Replace(txt)
while(newtxt)
  txt = newtxt
  newtxt = R.ReplaceNext(txt)</pre>

<blockquote><b>Result:</b><br />
Fred threw the blue ball to Jane. Jane caught the blue ball.</blockquote>

<p>After <tt>Replace()</tt> runs and has found a replacement successfully,
<tt>R.index</tt> points to the end of the replaced text. In the same way,
<tt>ReplaceNext()</tt> will replace the next match found.</p>

<p>Of course you can replace everything in one fell swoop using the
<tt>g</tt> flag. This will make <tt>Replace()</tt> replace everything it can
all at once.</p>

<pre>var/regex/R = new("/\\bred\\b/blue/g")
var/txt = "Fred threw the red ball to Jane. Jane caught the red ball."
txt = R.Replace(txt) || txt</pre>

<h3>Using groups</h3>

<p>If your pattern includes groups using parentheses, you can read the text
that was captured from that group by using <tt>GroupText()</tt>. This is
the equivalent of <tt>$1</tt>, <tt>$2</tt>, etc. in a language like Perl or
PHP.</p>

<pre>var/regex/digits = new("/(\\d+)/")
var/txt = "3 pigs and 4 chickens walk into a bar and order 50 punchlines."
if(digits.Find(txt))
  do
    world &lt;&lt; digits.GroupText(1)
  while(digits.FindNext(txt))</pre>

<blockquote><b>Result:</b><br />
3<br />4<br />50</blockquote>

<h3>Named variables</h3>

<p>You can insert your own variables by name into a search by using the
<tt>namedvars</tt> associative list.</p>

<pre>var/regex/R = new("/^$player logs (in|out) .*$/")
R.namedvars["player"] = player
if(R.Find(gamelog))
  do
    admin &lt;&lt; copytext(txt,R.match,R.index)
  while(R.FindNext(txt))</pre>

<a name="expr"></a><h3>Calling procs in replacement expressions</h3>

<p>By using the <tt>e</tt> flag, you can allow your replacement expression to
call a global proc, and include arguments. To do this you must put the proc
name inside brackets <tt>[]</tt>, and if any arguments are included, they go
inside parentheses and are separated by commas. (Do not put any spaces
between the proc name and the parentheses.) Remember, proc names are always
case-sensitive.</p>

<pre>/(\d+)\+(\d+)/[sum($1,$2)]/e</pre>

<p>This expression will search for a number, a <tt>+</tt> sign, and another
number, then add the two numbers using the <tt>sum()</tt> proc.</p>

<pre>// a and b are strings
proc/sum(a, b)
  return text2num(a) + text2num(b)

mob/verb/TestAdd()
  var/regex/add = new("/(\\d+)\\+(\\d+)/[sum($1,$2)]/e")
  var/txt = "What's 11+23?"
  txt = add.Replace(txt) || txt</pre>

<blockquote><b>Result:</b><br />
What's 34?</blockquote>

<p><tt>sum()</tt> is a global proc, and the arguments it receives are text
strings, in this case <tt>"11"</tt> and <tt>"23"</tt>. You can do anything
with these strings that you want. Here they were numbers to be added, but
you might want such a proc to calculate other values or format text in
particular ways.</p>

<h3>Splitting text</h3>

<p>The <tt>Split()</tt> proc will take text and split it up according to
this pattern. For example if your pattern is <tt>/,\s*/</tt>, you can split
up a list separated by commas with optional spaces.</p>

<pre>var/regex/commasplit = new("/,\\s*/")
var/list/items = commasplit.Split("trees, rocks, water, fire, air")
for(var/thing in items)
  world &lt;&lt; thing</pre>

<blockquote><b>Result:</b><br />
trees<br />rocks<br />water<br />fire<br />air</blockquote>

<p>There's a second argument to <tt>Split()</tt> which can make the split
inclusive. If this is nonzero, then the pattern matches themselves (in this
case <tt>",&nbsp;"</tt>) will be included in the list.</p>


<h2>A Few Examples</h2>

<h3>Add commas to numbers</h3>

<pre>var/regex/commafy = new("/(\\d+)(\\d{3})/$1,$2/g")
var/txt = "9000 peaches and 12345678 pretzels"
var/newtxt = commafy.Replace(txt)
while(newtxt)
  txt = newtxt
  newtxt = commafy.Replace(txt)</pre>

<blockquote><b>Result:</b><br />
9,000 peaches and 12,345,678 pretzels</blockquote>

<h3>Reformat paragraphs</h3>

<pre>var/regex/unpara = new("/([^\\n])\\n([^\\n])/$1$2/gs")
var/regex/repara = new("/^(.{,77}|\S{78,})\\s+/$1\\n/g")
txt = unpara.Replace(txt) || txt
txt = repara.Replace(txt) || txt</pre>

<a name="a"></a><h2>Appendix A: Regular Expression Basics</h2>

<p>If you've never used regular expressions before, this section will give
you a brief overview. Using the handy quick reference above as well as the
explanations in this section, you should have enough info to build your own
patterns.</p>

<p>A regular expression pattern may take two forms:</p>

<pre>/<i>pattern</i>/<i>flags</i>
/<i>pattern</i>/<i>replacement</i>/<i>flags</i></pre>

<p>A basic pattern may contain something as simple as a single word or
phrase. Literal text is easy to find. If you want to find it without worrying
about upper- or lowercase, use the <tt>i</tt> flag at the end of the
pattern.</p>

<pre>/a basic pattern/i</pre>

<p>The <tt>/</tt> character is a delimiter, which marks where the pattern
ends. Almost any character may be used as a delimiter, including <tt>#</tt>
or <tt>!</tt> or letters. Any character you use this way, though, can't have
a special meaning in the pattern, so if you use <tt>|</tt>, you can't use
<tt>a|b</tt> to mean "find a or b". If you want to use that same character
as literal text in the pattern, you should be able to escape it with a
backslash <tt>\</tt>. For example, you can use <tt>/\d+\/\d+\/\d{2,4}/</tt>
to read a date.</p>

<p>For special characters, backslashes are very important. Any special
character you want to use like a normal one, including a backslash, needs a
backslash in front of it. As in regular DM, some things like <tt>\n</tt> or
<tt>\t</tt> have special meaning. But there are more special escape
sequences, including <tt>\d</tt> which means digits 0-9. If you use a
backslash in your pattern, you'll probably need to use two when writing it as
a BYOND string. The example above would have to be written as
<tt>"/\\d+\\/\d+\\/\\d{2,4}/"</tt>. For the rest of this appendix, it's
assumed that you know that; the patterns you see will be the "raw" pattern
like the one above, not in a BYOND string form.</p>

<p>Some characters are easier to include using an ASCII code than the
actual character itself. <tt>\x<i>nn</i></tt> will produce a character from a
hexadecimal code; i.e. <tt>\x41</tt> is <tt>A</tt>. You can do a similar
thing with octal, where <tt>\0101</tt> is <tt>A</tt>, but the leading 0 is
needed.</p>

<h3>Simple operators</h3>

<p>Finding just text you can already do with BYOND's built-in procs, though,
so let's move on to the meat of regular expressions and some of the things
that patterns can include.</p>

<p>It's possible to search along word breaks using <tt>\b</tt>, or non-breaks
using <tt>\B</tt>. Thus, <tt>/\bbrick\b/i</tt> will match <tt>"brick"</tt>
but it will not match <tt>"bricklayer"</tt>.</p>

<p>You can match just at the beginning of a line by using <tt>^</tt> and at
the end of a line using <tt>$</tt>. <tt>\A</tt> and <tt>\Z</tt> mean the same
things, except that if you use the <tt>s</tt> flag to treat your text like a
single line, they'll only match the beginning and end of the entire text.</p>

<pre>/^you can/i
/using \$\.$/</pre>

<p>If you want to find one of several possible choices, then <tt>|</tt> which
means "or" is the right tool for the job.</p>

<pre>/banana|raspberry|grape/i</pre>

<p>There are many other things you can find in a regular expression. A single
period <tt>.</tt> will match any character. Brackets <tt>[]</tt> will find
any character that matches what's between them; e.g. <tt>[AEIOUaeiou]</tt>
will match a vowel, or <tt>[a-z]</tt> will match any lowercase letter. Or you
can use the opposite of this by putting <tt>^</tt> at the beginning of your
list of characters, so <tt>[^AEIOUaeiou]</tt> matches any character that is
<i>not</i> a vowel. There are other kinds of character matches you can do
easily without brackets:</p>

<blockquote><table>
<tr><td class=first>\d</td><td class=last>Any digit 0-9</td><td class=first>\D</td><td>Anything but 0-9</td></tr>
<tr><td class=first>\w</td><td class=last>0-9, A-Z, a-z, or _</td><td class=first>\W</td><td>Anything but \w</td></tr>
<tr><td class=first>\s</td><td class=last>Whitespace</td><td class=first>\S</td><td>Non-whitespace</td></tr>
<tr><td class=first>\l</td><td class=last>Any lowercase letter</td><td class=first>\L</td><td>Any uppercase or non-letter</td></tr>
<tr><td class=first>\u</td><td class=last>Any uppercase letter</td><td class=first>\U</td><td>Any lowercase or non-letter</td></tr>
</table></blockquote>

<h3>Modifiers</h3>

<p>Of course, it's not as much use to find any old character as to find it a
certain number of times. That's where modifiers come in. Modifiers go right
after part of the pattern and say how many times you want to find that
part.</p>

<blockquote><table>
<tr><td class=first>*</td><td>Match 0 or more times</td></tr>
<tr><td class=first>+</td><td>Match 1 or more times</td></tr>
<tr><td class=first>?</td><td>Match 0 or 1 time</td></tr>
<tr><td class=first>{<i>n</i>}</td><td>Match exactly <i>n</i> times</td></tr>
<tr><td class=first>{<i>n</i>,}</td><td>Match at least <i>n</i> times</td></tr>
<tr><td class=first>{<i>n</i>,<i>m</i>}</td><td>Match <i>n</i> to <i>m</i> times</td></tr>
</table></blockquote>

<p>A modifier after a bit of text will just match the last character. That
is, <tt>clue+</tt> will look for <tt>clue</tt> followed by any more
<tt>e</tt>'s that immediately follow it. To use <tt>+</tt> for the entire
block of text you need a group, which is done by putting parentheses around
the text. <tt>(clue)+</tt> will match anywhere that <tt>clue</tt> is found at
least once in a row.</p>

<p>One important thing to know about modifiers is that they're greedy. That
is, they'll find as much as they possibly can. <tt>/ed.*ed/i</tt> will match
all of <tt>"Ed jumped on the bed"</tt>, because <tt>.*</tt> will keep
searching for more as long as there's an <tt>ed</tt> to follow it. To make
the modifier non-greedy, use a <tt>?</tt> after it. Searching the same text
with <tt>/ed.*?ed/i</tt> will result in "Ed jumped".</p>

<h3>Groups</h3>

<p>Using parentheses to group things together is very useful. For one thing,
you can use <tt>|</tt> inside a group. Try out this expression:</p>

<pre>/(gold|silver|copper) coins?/i</pre>

<p>That will match <tt>"copper coins"</tt> or <tt>"Silver coin"</tt>.</p>

<p>When you use a group to match some text, a backreference will match that
same text later on in the pattern. A backreference looks like
<tt>\<i>n</i></tt>, where it matches the <i>n</i>th group. Say for example
that you want to match <tt>"Gold coins made of gold"</tt> but not <tt>"brass
knuckles made of wood"</tt>. A backreference will do the trick.</p>

<pre>/([a-z]+) [a-z'\-]+ made of \1/i</pre>

<p>The group will capture the material like gold or brass, so it can be
matched again in the backreference <tt>\1</tt>.</p>

<p>In a replacement pattern, you'd use <tt>$<i>n</i></tt> to replace part
of a match with what was found in a group. Here's a simple replacement
that will do that:</p>

<pre>/([a-z]+) ([a-z'\-]+)/$2 of $1/</pre>

<p>Here, <tt>"crystal jars"</tt> becomes <tt>"jars of crystal"</tt>.</p>

<p>In both search and replacement patterns, you can use named variables
by including them as <tt>$<i>name</i></tt>. The value of this can be set at
any time by setting <tt>regex.namedvars[name]=value</tt>.</p>

<h3>Replacement</h3>

<p>As you can see, replacing text isn't all that hard. Obviously replacements
won't use most of the search operators like brackets, parentheses, or
modifiers, so they're usually interpreted literally. There's one important
thing to know about replacements, though: If you use the <tt>g</tt> flag at
the end of your pattern, any replacement will be done on every single match.
With this you could change all coconuts to raisins.</p>

<pre>/coconut/raisin/ig</pre>

<p>This is a case-insensitive replacement, but if an uppercase Coconut is
found, it will be replaced with a lowercase raisin.</p>

<p>You may also call procs in replacement patterns by using the <tt>e</tt>
flag <a href="#expr">as described above</a>.</p>
