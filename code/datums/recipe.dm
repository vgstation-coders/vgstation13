 * This is powerful and flexible recipe system.
 * It exists not only for food.
 * supports both reagents and objects as prerequisites.
 * In order to use this system you have to define a deriative from /datum/recipe
 * * reagents are reagents. Acid, milc, booze, etc.
 * * items are objects. Fruits, tools, circuit boards.
 * * result is type to create as new object
 * * time is optional parameter, you shall use in in your machine,
     default /datum/recipe/ procs does not rely on this parameter.
 *
 *  Functions you need:
 *  /datum/recipe/proc/make(var/obj/container as obj)
 *    Creates result inside container,
 *    deletes prerequisite reagents,
 *    transfers reagents from prerequisite objects,
 *    deletes all prerequisite objects (even not needed for recipe at the moment).
 *
 *  /proc/select_recipe(list/datum/recipe/avaiable_recipes, obj/obj as obj, exact = 1)
 *    Wonderful function that select suitable recipe for you.
 *    obj is a machine (or magik hat) with prerequisites,
 *    exact = 0 forces algorithm to ignore superfluous stuff.
 *
 *  Functions you do not need to call directly but could:
 *  /datum/recipe/proc/check_reagents(var/datum/reagents/avail_reagents)
 *    //1 = precisely,  0 = insufficiently, -1 = superfluous
 *
 *  /datum/recipe/proc/check_items(var/obj/container as obj)
 *    //1 = precisely, 0=insufficiently, -1 = superfluous
 *

//The person who made this honestly thought that the average coder from the distant future of 2018 would understand any of this shit without a thorough and painful examination
//And this is exactly why any Chemistry-related system is impenetrable to anyone but the best coders, even things theorically as simple as this
//So as I decrypt this arcane coding technology, I'll add comments where I see it fit, so absolutely fucking everywhere
//I'll take my Nobel Prize with fries thank you
//And yes indeed I know it's a lot of comments, but if you're not here to understand how recipes work, why are you here ?
