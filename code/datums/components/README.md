## DATUM COMPONENTS

## OVERVIEW

This system is an overhaul of the rudimentary component system introduced by N3X15 in 2017 for mob AI.
The goal of this overhaul is to provide an extensible component system usable for all sorts of things,
kind of like TGstation's datum component system (DCS)--while avoiding the pitfalls of that system.
