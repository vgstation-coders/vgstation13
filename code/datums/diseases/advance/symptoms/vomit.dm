Vomiting

	Very Very Noticable.
	Decreases resistance.
	Doesn't increase stage speed.
	Little transmittable.
	Medium Level.

Bonus
	Forces the affected mob to vomit!
	Meaning your disease can spread via
	people walking on vomit.
	Makes the affected mob lose nutrition and
	heal toxin damage.
