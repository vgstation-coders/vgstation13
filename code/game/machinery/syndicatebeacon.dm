//  Beacon randomly spawns in space
//	When a non-traitor (no special role in /mind) uses it, he is given the choice to become a traitor
//	If he accepts there is a random chance he will be accepted, rejected, or rejected and killed
//	Bringing certain items can help improve the chance to become a traitor
