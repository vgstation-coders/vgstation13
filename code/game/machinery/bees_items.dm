				<h3>Raising Bees</h3>

				Bees are loving but fickle creatures. Don't mess with their hive and stay away from any clusters of them, and you'll avoid their ire.
				Sometimes, you'll need to dig around in there for those delicious sweeties though - in that case make sure you wear sealed protection gear
				and carry an extinguisher or smoker with you - any bees chasing you, once calmed down, can thusly be netted and returned safely to the hive.
				Beezeez is a cure-all panacea for them, use it on an apiary to kickstart it, but use it too much and the hive may grow to apocalyptic proportions.
				Other than that, bees are excellent pets for all the family and are excellent caretakers of one's garden:
				having a hive or two around will aid in the longevity and growth rate of plants, and aid them in fighting off poisons and disease.

				<h3>Dealing with Feral Bees</h3>

				If someone attacks the hive or some of the bees, you can bet that they won't like it and retaliate with murderous intent.
				To fix such a situation, you will have to capture the bees and place them back into their apiary. Doing so is a two step process.
				But before that, you'll want to acquire yourself a Bio suit to protect yourself from stings.
				First you need to spray the bees with water. Chemistry sprays, fire extinguishers, smoke grenades, anything works as long as it has some water in it.
				Once the bees are calmed, swing your bee net at them. If the bees aren't calmed first, you will only angry them further!
				It is strongly disadvised to empty your bee net anywhere beside in the apiary, you might have to deal with an even more ferocious outbreak if you empty your net
				outside after having caught them all.

				<h3>Collecting Honeycombs</h3>

				Collecting honeycombs is a relatively simple process, but you'll need to make some preparations, such as getting a Bio suit or prepairing another apiary where to move the bees.
				First you start by deconstructing the apiary with a hatchet. The bees will become aggressive as soon as you begin. Once the apiary is deconstructed, follow the steps in the above
				section to capture the homeless feral bees and move them to another apiary. Or simply rebuild the apiary that you just deconstructed. The honeycombs harvested this way
				are full of honey, you can grind them to process the liquid, then place it in a Condimaster to conserve it in a honey pot. Or you can just eat the honeycombs if you feel like it,
				they are delicious.
