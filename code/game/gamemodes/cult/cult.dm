//Objectives revamped in February 2015 by Deity Link #vgstation

//Cult round flow:
//* at the beginning of the round, cultists aren't able to summon Nar-Sie.
//* during the first phase, cultists start the round with only one objective: either "bloodspill", "convert", or "sacrifice"
//* once they complete that objective, the game checks how well the cult is performing (Are there still at least 4 of them? Are they getting outnumbered by loyalty implanted people?)
//* if the cult is performing well, the game will try to give them another objective among the above three.
//* if the cult is in bad shape, or all objectives have been completed, or none of the remaining possible objectives are feasible, then the game let's them summon Nar-Sie
//* once Nar-Sie is summonned, the shuttle automatically arrives after 10 minutes (even if the shuttle was already on its way) and can't be recalled
//* the cultists get one last bonus objective to complete before the round ends: either "harvest", "hijack", or "massacre"

//* the cult "wins" as soon as it summons Nar-Sie.
