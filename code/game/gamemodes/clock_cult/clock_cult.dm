CLOCKWORK CULT: Based off of the failed pull requests from /vg/

While Nar-Sie is the oldest and most prominent of the elder gods, there are other forces at work in the universe.
Ratvar, the Clockwork Justiciar, a homage to Nar-Sie granted sentience by its own power, is one such other force.
Imprisoned within a massive construct known as the Celestial Derelict - or Reebe - an intense hatred of the Blood God festers.
Ratvar, unable to act in the mortal plane, seeks to return and forms covenants with mortals in order to bolster his influence.
Due to his mechanical nature, Ratvar is also capable of influencing silicon-based lifeforms, unlike Nar-Sie, who can only influence natural life.

This is a team-based gamemode, and the team's objective is shared by all cultists. Their goal is to defend an object called the Ark on a separate z-level.

The clockwork version of an arcane tome is the clockwork slab.

This file's folder contains:
	clock_cult.dm: Core gamemode files.
	clock_effect.dm: The base clockwork effect code.
	- Effect files are in game/gamemodes/clock_cult/clock_effects/
	clock_item.dm: The base clockwork item code.
	- Item files are in game/gamemodes/clock_cult/clock_items/
	clock_mobs.dm: Hostile clockwork creatures.
	clock_scripture.dm: The base Scripture code.
	- Scripture files are in game/gamemodes/clock_cult/clock_scripture/
	clock_structure.dm: The base clockwork structure code, including clockwork machines.
	- Structure files, and Ratvar, are in game/gamemodes/clock_cult/clock_structures/

	game/gamemodes/clock_cult/clock_helpers/ contains several helper procs, including the Ratvarian language.

	clockcult defines are in __DEFINES/clockcult.dm

	Here's a quick primer on what you should know here.\
	<ol>\
	<li>You're in a place called Reebe right now. The crew can't get here normally.</li>\
	<li>In the north is your base camp, with supplies, consoles, and the Ark. In the south is an inaccessible area that the crew can walk between \
	once they arrive (more on that later.) Everything between that space is an open area.</li>\
	<li>Your job as a servant is to build fortifications and defenses to protect the Ark and your base once the Ark activates. You can do this \
	however you like, but work with your allies and coordinate your efforts.</li>\
	<li>Once the Ark activates, the station will be alerted. Portals to Reebe will open up in nearly every room. When they take these portals, \
	the crewmembers will arrive in the area that you can't access, but can get through it freely - whereas you can't. Treat this as the \"spawn\" of the \
	crew and defend it accordingly.</li>\
	</ol>\
	<hr>\
	Here is the layout of Reebe, from left to right:\
	<ul>\
	<li><b>Dressing Room:</b> Contains clothing, a dresser, and a mirror. There are spare slabs and absconders here.</li>\
	<li><b>Listening Station:</b> Contains intercoms, a telecomms relay, and a list of frequencies.</li>\
	<li><b>Ark Chamber:</b> Houses the Ark.</li>\
	<li><b>Observation Room:</b> Contains five camera observers. These can be used to watch the station through its cameras, as well as to teleport down \
	to most areas. To do this, use the Warp action while hovering over the tile you want to warp to.</li>\
	<li><b>Infirmary:</b> Contains sleepers and basic medical supplies for superficial wounds. The sleepers can consume Vitality to heal any occupants. \
	This room is generally more useful during the preparation phase; when defending the Ark, scripture is more useful.</li>\
