	desc				= "Spawns a alloy body similar to Neovgre that requires a soul vessel/posibrain/MMI to be inserted. Once inserted, the mind takes control and can control it to attack others with powerful melee attacks. The body slowly regenerates damage, and can be restored by Mending Motors and the like. If destroyed, the mind is permanently lost, as it irreversibly fused with the alloy."
