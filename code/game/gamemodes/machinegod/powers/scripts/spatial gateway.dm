If more than one cultist chants, the required time is reduced. Anyone not affiliated with a god will experience slight trauma upon exiting portals. If 6 or more cultists are present, the teleport is instant and the portal changes color, unsafely teleporting any unfaithfuls to random locations. In addition, if 9 or more cultists are present, the portal explodes and any nearby non-cultists are instantly gibbed."
