	name			= "Volt Void"
	desc			= "While chanting, the cultist will glow a brilliant orange, and proceed to drain energy from all APCs, mechas, pods, borgs, and other electronic equipment in the vicinity. The energy will be redirected to the cultist's body parts, causing burn damage over time that scales with how much is absorbed. The damage can be fatal if allowed to channel for too long. Robotic limbs are restored instead of damaged, and have priority to receive energy over flesh, allowing augmented cultists to use Volt Void for longer periods of time."
