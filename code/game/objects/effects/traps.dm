//There are two ways to create an invisible object that plays a sound when you step on it
//First way is to use a narrator (/obj/effect/narration) and set its 'play_sound' var to the sound
//This will play the sound locally to everybody who steps on it, once

//The other way is to create a sound trap that only works once. The sound made by it will be heard by everybody nearby
