/*
 * Plushies are toys that can be hugged to synthesize some paracetamol, providing an alternative to hugging humans for incels.
 * They can also have the stuffing removed and replaced with a grenade to create an explosive surprise for the next person to hug the plushie.
 * They might also make a sound when interacted with.
