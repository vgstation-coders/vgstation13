				<h3>Singularity Safety in Special Circumstances</h3>

				<h4>Power outage</h4>

				A power problem has made the entire station loose power? Could be station-wide wiring problems or syndicate power sinks. In any case follow these steps:
				<p>
				<b>Step one:</b> <b><font color='red'>PANIC!</font></b><br>
				<b>Step two:</b> Get your ass over to engineering! <b>QUICKLY!!!</b><br>
				<b>Step three:</b> Get to the <b>Area Power Controller</b> which controls the power to the emitters.<br>
				<b>Step four:</b> Swipe it with your <b>ID card</b> - if it doesn't unlock, continue with step 15.<br>
				<b>Step five:</b> Open the console and disengage the cover lock.<br>
				<b>Step six:</b> Pry open the APC with a <b>Crowbar.</b><br>
				<b>Step seven:</b> Take out the empty <b>power cell.</b><br>
				<b>Step eight:</b> Put in the new, <b>full power cell</b> - if you don't have one, continue with step 15.<br>
				<b>Step nine:</b> Quickly put on a <b>Radiation suit.</b><br>
				<b>Step ten:</b> Check if the <b>singularity field generators</b> withstood the down-time - if they didn't, continue with step 15.<br>
				<b>Step eleven:</b> Since disaster was averted you now have to ensure it doesn't repeat. If it was a powersink which caused it and if the engineering apc is wired to the same powernet, which the powersink is on, you have to remove the piece of wire which links the apc to the powernet. If it wasn't a powersink which caused it, then skip to step 14.<br>
				<b>Step twelve:</b> Grab your crowbar and pry away the tile closest to the APC.<br>
				<b>Step thirteen:</b> Use the wirecutters to cut the wire which is conecting the grid to the terminal. <br>
				<b>Step fourteen:</b> Go to the bar and tell the guys how you saved them all. Stop reading this guide here.<br>
				<b>Step fifteen:</b> <b>GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE!!!</b><br>
				</p>

				<h4>Shields get damaged</h4>

				Step one: <b>GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE!!! FORGET THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN, SAVE YOURSELF!!!</b><br>

				<h3>Growing Dionae</h3>

				What are Dionae? These fun little plant people are something that every botanist needs to understand.
				<p>
				Dionae nypmh pods will produce a single nymph. Most of the time the nymph dies out producing more seeds for replanting but when a nymph fully realizes it will start crawling about and now has some new abilties!<br>
				Dionae can fertilze your crop, eat weeds and help around if they are willing.<br>
				Among the Dionae nymphs needs is blood collection. They are likely to flick out their feelers at new people around itself nicking a sample of their blood. <br>
				This blood sample is used by Dionae biology to gather the biological symbols from its source to garnish itself with new memories. They tend to mimic anything from their vocal patterns, languages, attitudes and opinons.<br>
				However this does not mean that they necessarily need to follow your every whim. They tend to form their own wants and needs, and your green children do grow up fast. With enough collected memory they will evolve into adult Dionae.<br>
				The Adult Dionae is not as capable a garden helper but they can apply to be a member of the station and to help you further as a normal botanist!<br>
				Its important to keep track of all your green creations as they tend to get into trouble if left to their own devices. They choose weather they want to help around the plants but encourage it!

				<h1>Science For Dummies</h1>
				So you want to further SCIENCE? Good man/woman/thing! However, SCIENCE is a complicated process even though it's quite easy. For the most part, it's a three step process:
				<ol>
					<li> 1) Deconstruct items in the Destructive Analyzer to advance technology or improve the design.</li>
					<li> 2) Build unlocked designs in the Protolathe and Circuit Imprinter</li>
					<li> 3) Repeat!</li>
				</ol>

				Those are the basic steps to furthing science. What do you do science with, however? Well, you have four major tools: R&D Console, the Destructive Analyzer, the Protolathe, and the Circuit Imprinter.

				<h2>The R&D Console</h2>
				The R&D console is the cornerstone of any research lab. It is the central system from which the Destructive Analyzer, Protolathe, and Circuit Imprinter (your R&D systems) are controled. More on those systems in their own sections. On its own, the R&D console acts as a database for all your technological gains and new devices you discover. So long as the R&D console remains intact, you'll retain all that SCIENCE you've discovered. Protect it though, because if it gets damaged, you'll lose your data! In addition to this important purpose, the R&D console has a disk menu that lets you transfer data from the database onto disk or from the disk into the database. It also has a settings menu that lets you re-sync with nearby R&D devices (if they've become disconnected), lock the console from the unworthy, upload the data to all other R&D consoles in the network (all R&D consoles are networked by default), connect/disconnect from the network, and purge all data from the database.
				<b>NOTE:</b> The technology list screen, circuit imprinter, and protolathe menus are accessible by non-scientists. This is intended to allow 'public' systems for the plebians to utilize some new devices.

				<h2>Destructive Analyzer</h2>
				This is the source of all technology. Whenever you put a handheld object in it, it analyzes it and determines what sort of technological advancements you can discover from it. If the technology of the object is equal or higher then your current knowledge, you can destroy the object to further those sciences. Some devices (notably, some devices made from the protolathe and circuit imprinter) aren't 100% reliable when you first discover them. If these devices break down, you can put them into the Destructive Analyzer and improve their reliability rather then futher science. If their reliability is high enough ,it'll also advance their related technologies.

				<h2>Circuit Imprinter</h2>
				This machine, along with the Protolathe, is used to actually produce new devices. The Circuit Imprinter takes glass and various chemicals (depends on the design) to produce new circuit boards to build new machines or computers. It can even be used to print AI modules.

				<h2>Protolathe</h2>
				This machine is an advanced form of the Autolathe that produce non-circuit designs. Unlike the Autolathe, it can use processed metal, glass, solid plasma, silver, gold, and diamonds along with a variety of chemicals to produce devices. The downside is that, again, not all devices you make are 100% reliable when you first discover them.

				<h1>Reliability and You</h1>
				As it has been stated, many devices when they're first discovered do not have a 100% reliablity when you first discover them. Instead, the reliablity of the device is dependent upon a base reliability value, whatever improvements to the design you've discovered through the Destructive Analyzer, and any advancements you've made with the device's source technologies. To be able to improve the reliability of a device, you have to use the device until it breaks beyond repair. Once that happens, you can analyze it in a Destructive Analyzer. Once the device reachs a certain minimum reliability, you'll gain tech advancements from it.

				<h1>Building a Better Machine</h1>
				Many machines produces from circuit boards and inserted into a machine frame require a variety of parts to construct. These are parts like capacitors, batteries, matter bins, and so forth. As your knowledge of science improves, more advanced versions are unlocked. If you use these parts when constructing something, its attributes may be improved. For example, if you use an advanced matter bin when constructing an autolathe (rather then a regular one), it'll hold more materials. Experiment around with stock parts of various qualities to see how they affect the end results! Be warned, however: Tier 3 and higher stock parts don't have 100% reliability and their low reliability may affect the reliability of the end machine.

				  <li>Pen</li>
				</ul>

				<h2><a name="Construction">Cyborg Construction</h2>
				Cyborg construction is a rather easy process, requiring a decent amount of metal and a few other supplies.<br>The required materials to make a cyborg are:
				<ul>
				  <li>Metal</li>
				  <li>Two Flashes</li>
				  <li>One Power Cell (Preferrably rated to 15000w)</li>
				  <li>Some electrical wires</li>
				  <li>One Human Brain</li>
				  <li>One Man-Machine Interface</li>
				</ul>
				Once you have acquired the materials, you can start on construction of your cyborg.<br>To construct a cyborg, follow the steps below:
				<ol>
				  <li>Start the Exosuit Fabricators constructing all of the cyborg parts</li>
				  <li>While the parts are being constructed, take your human brain, and place it inside the Man-Machine Interface</li>
				  <li>Once you have a Robot Head, place your two flashes inside the eye sockets</li>
				  <li>Once you have your Robot Chest, wire the Robot chest, then insert the power cell</li>
				  <li>Attach all of the Robot parts to the Robot frame</li>
				  <li>Insert the Man-Machine Interface (With the Brain inside) Into the Robot Body</li>
				  <li>Congratulations! You have a new cyborg!</li>
				</ol>

				<h2><a name="Maintenance">Cyborg Maintenance</h2>
				Occasionally Cyborgs may require maintenance of a couple types, this could include replacing a power cell with a charged one, or possibly maintaining the cyborg's internal wiring.

				<h3>Replacing a Power Cell</h3>
				Replacing a Power cell is a common type of maintenance for cyborgs. It usually involves replacing the cell with a fully charged one, or upgrading the cell with a larger capacity cell.<br>The steps to replace a cell are follows:
				<ol>
				  <li>Unlock the Cyborg's Interface by swiping your ID on it</li>
				  <li>Open the Cyborg's outer panel using a crowbar</li>
				  <li>Remove the old power cell</li>
				  <li>Insert the new power cell</li>
				  <li>Close the Cyborg's outer panel using a crowbar</li>
				  <li>Lock the Cyborg's Interface by swiping your ID on it, this will prevent non-qualified personnel from attempting to remove the power cell</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Exposing the Internal Wiring</h3>
				Exposing the internal wiring of a cyborg is fairly easy to do, and is mainly used for cyborg repairs.<br>You can easily expose the internal wiring by following the steps below:
				<ol>
				  <li>Follow Steps 1 - 3 of "Replacing a Cyborg's Power Cell"</li>
				  <li>Open the cyborg's internal wiring panel by using a screwdriver to unsecure the panel</li>
			  </ol>
			  To re-seal the cyborg's internal wiring:
			  <ol>
			    <li>Use a screwdriver to secure the cyborg's internal panel</li>
			    <li>Follow steps 4 - 6 of "Replacing a Cyborg's Power Cell" to close up the cyborg</li>
			  </ol>

			  <h2><a name="Repairs">Cyborg Repairs</h2>
			  Occasionally a Cyborg may become damaged. This could be in the form of impact damage from a heavy or fast-travelling object, or it could be heat damage from high temperatures, or even lasers or Electromagnetic Pulses (EMPs).

			  <h3>Dents</h3>
			  If a cyborg becomes damaged due to impact from heavy or fast-moving objects, it will become dented. Sure, a dent may not seem like much, but it can compromise the structural integrity of the cyborg, possibly causing a critical failure.
			  Dents in a cyborg's frame are rather easy to repair, all you need is to apply a welding tool to the dented area, and the high-tech cyborg frame will repair the dent under the heat of the welder.

        <h3>Excessive Heat Damage</h3>
        If a cyborg becomes damaged due to excessive heat, it is likely that the internal wires will have been damaged. You must replace those wires to ensure that the cyborg remains functioning properly.<br>To replace the internal wiring follow the steps below:
        <ol>
          <li>Unlock the Cyborg's Interface by swiping your ID</li>
          <li>Open the Cyborg's External Panel using a crowbar</li>
          <li>Remove the Cyborg's Power Cell</li>
          <li>Using a screwdriver, expose the internal wiring or the Cyborg</li>
          <li>Replace the damaged wires inside the cyborg</li>
          <li>Secure the internal wiring cover using a screwdriver</li>
          <li>Insert the Cyborg's Power Cell</li>
          <li>Close the Cyborg's External Panel using a crowbar</li>
          <li>Lock the Cyborg's Interface by swiping your ID</li>
        </ol>
        These repair tasks may seem difficult, but are essential to keep your cyborgs running at peak efficiency.

        <h2><a name="Emergency">In Case of Emergency</h2>
        In case of emergency, there are a few steps you can take.

        <h3>"Rogue" Cyborgs</h3>
        If the cyborgs seem to become "rogue", they may have non-standard laws. In this case, use extreme caution.
        To repair the situation, follow these steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Locate the nearest robotics console</li>
          <li>Determine which cyborgs are "Rogue"</li>
          <li>Press the lockdown button to immobolize the cyborg</li>
          <li>Locate the cyborg</li>
          <li>Expose the cyborg's internal wiring</li>
          <li>Check to make sure the LawSync and AI Sync lights are lit</li>
          <li>If they are not lit, pulse the LawSync wire using a multitool to enable the cyborg's Law Sync</li>
          <li>Proceed to a cyborg upload console. Nanotrasen usually places these in the same location as AI uplaod consoles.</li>
          <li>Use a "Reset" upload moduleto reset the cyborg's laws</li>
          <li>Proceed to a Robotics Control console</li>
          <li>Remove the lockdown on the cyborg</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>As a last resort</h3>
        If all else fails in a case of cyborg-related emergency. There may be only one option. Using a Robotics Control console, you may have to remotely detonate the cyborg.
        <h3>WARNING:</h3> Do not detonate a borg without an explicit reason for doing so. Cyborgs are expensive pieces of Nanotrasen equipment, and you may be punished for detonating them without reason.

				<h3>Guide to disposal mailing system</h3>
                Most people misunderstand how disposal mailing system works; items are sent in bunches, not individually.<br>

				<h4>So, how does it work?</h4>
				<ul>
				<li>When an item enters the delivery chute inside the delivery office, a countdown starts. It's about 10 seconds</li>
                  <li>If another item enters the delivery chute before the countdown ends, the countdown resets and starts again</li>
                  <li>If the countdown expires, you can hear the faint noise of a piston and <b>all</b> the items inside the delivery chute will be sent <b>to the same destination</b></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>What will be the destination?</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>If there are no tagged items, all the items will be sent to the recycling room</li>
                  <li>If there is one item wrapped+tagged, <b>all</b> the items, even the unwrapped/untagged ones and garbage, will be sent at the destination of the tagged item</li>
                  <li>If there are multiple wrapped+tagged items at the same time inside the delivery chute, the last one sets the destination</li>
                  <li>If there is a living person or animal inside the delivery chute, all the stuff with it will be sent to the recycling room anyway, ignoring tags; however, you can send living people or animals to a destination if they are inside a container (closets, coffins, animal crates); for living people, it works only if the container is wrapped.<br>
                Anyway, corpses and dead animals will reach a parcel's destination</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Examples</h4>
                <b><i>You need to send 4 crates to engineering:</i></b><br>
                just put all 4 of them on the conveyor belt and wrap+tag one (1) of them as "Engineering"; all of them will reach engineering.<br>
                <br>
                <i><b>You need to send a goat crate to hydroponics but the goat crate is unwrappable/untaggable:</i></b><br>
                just take any other item, for example a piece of paper, wrap+tag it as "Hydroponics", put the wrapped paper and the goat crate both on the conveior belt and let them go together; both of them will reach hydroponics.<br>
                <br>
                <i><b>You send 3 parcels in the same shipment, one tagged "Bar", one tagged "Theatre" and the last one tagged "Medbay":</i></b><br>
                all 3 parcels will be sent to medbay (this is the case when people see parcels reaching the wrong destination).<br>

                <h4>Mail outlet</h4>
                Inside the delivery office, there is a also a mail outlet that has the purpose of filtering untagged parcels from trash; this is intended to be used by all crew outside cargo to let them use the mailing service without the need to go to cargo.<br>
                <br>
                Example:
                <ol>
                  <li>a scientist needs to send an item to medbay</li>
                  <li>he uses package wrap to wrap the item (there is some package wrap in many department and also in the tool storage room, more package wrap can be bought from cargo too)</li>
                  <li>the scientist can use a pen to add a note to the parcel, for example "send to medbay"</li>
                  <li>the scientist places the parcel inside a disposal bin</li>
                  <li>(optional but advised: the scientist could contact cargo staff telling them that he sent a parcel)</li>
                  <li>the parcel will reach cargo and pop out from the mail outlet instead of the trash outlet</li>
                  <li>cargo tech will see the parcel, read the note on it, tag it as "medbay" and just use the mailing system as usual</li>
                </ol>

				</ul>
				<h3 id="chapter0">Preamble: Quick, how do I cure a disease?</h3>
				<p>Because let's be honest, unless you are a diplomed Pathologist, this is most likely the reason why you openned this manual. Now keep calm, put on a sterile mask and some latex gloves, and follow these steps:</p>
				<dl>
				  <dt>1- Inject patient with 5u of spaceacillin</dt>
				  <dd>Easily found in any Nanomed, or at Chemistry. This will slowly reinforce the patient's immune system to help it combat the pathogen, and allow for a vaccine to be isolated afterwards.</dd>
				  <dt>2- Scan the patient with an Health Analyzer</dt>
				  <dd>&#8226; If nothing shows up, then either there is no disease at all or you're dealing with a more simple disease. Use the body scanner to identify it. The rest of the steps do not apply to those diseases, in which case, <b><font color='orange'>Sorry</font></b>, check out an external guide.</dd>
				  <dd>&#8226; If the pathogen is in the database, the analyzer will identify its antigens, allowing you to check Chemistry's smartfridge for a supply of a corresponding vaccine. 5u of vaccine are enough to kill even the strongest diseases after a few seconds. If there is no vaccine available, move on to the next step.</dd>
				  <dd>&#8226; If the pathogen is Unknown, take a blood sample from the patient and deliver it to Virology so the disease can be identified later, then move on to the next step.</dd>
				  <dt>3- Scan the patient with an Immunity Scanner</dt>
				  <dd>The results will display the status of the patient's immune system, most importantly their antibody concentrations, and the strength of any disease present.</dd>
				  <dd>&#8226;If the disease's strength is of about 50% or less, spaceacillin will cure the disease on its own after a few minutes. Resting in a bed can speed up the process. <b><font color='green'>Good Work</font></b>.</dd>
				  <dd>&#8226;If the disease's strength is above 50%, move on the the next step.</dd>
				  <dt>4- Have the patient lie in a bed...</dt>
				  <dd>...until the antibody concentration reaches 50%, <b>then take a blood sample</b> and move on to the next step. This should take about minute, so now is as good of a time as any to analyze the pathogen.</dd>
				  <dd>&#8226; If after the analysis the pathogen turns out to have very dangerous symptoms, throw the patient in cryo, as very low temperatures will completely freeze the pathogen. Cryo can also speed up antibody production in place of a bed, so you can do it preemptively if you feel like it.</dd>
				  <dt>5- Split the blood sample into two vials, and insert them in the 1st and 3rd (or 2nd and 4th) slots of an Isolation Centrifuge. </dt>
				  <dd>Splitting into two vials allows both to keep the centrifuge balanced which will allow the vaccine synthesizing to progress at optimal speed, and also to create vaccines for both antigen.</dd>
				  <dt>6- After selecting the antigen to synthesize vaccine from, turn on the centrifuge. </dt>
				  <dd>Synthesizing takes one minute at 50% concentration.</dd>
				  <dd>Each subsequent percent will divide the time needed by two.</dd>
				  <dd>Each lacking percent will cause the synthesizing to take an additional minute.</dd>
				  <dd>Only antibodies with at least 30% concentration can be turned into vaccine.</dd>
				  <dt>7- Administer up to 5u of vaccine to the patient. </dt>
				  <dd>Each unit of vaccine raises the concentration by 20%. The disease will die as soon as antibody concentration overcomes the disease's strength. <b><font color='green'>Good Work</font></b>.</dd>
				  <dd>Leftover vaccine should be brought to Chemistry, so it can be mixed with more (blank) vaccine, created by mixing Water, Aluminum, and Sugar.</dd>
				</dl>

				<p>And now, on with the proper guide.</p>
				<h3 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: Proper Safety</h3>
				<p>You should always wear a sterile mask, white shoes, and latex gloves before entering Virology, or alternatively a full bio suit, as growth dishes have to be kept open during incubation and analysis, which may cause infections in surrounding unprotected individuals.</p>
				<p>There are three main known vectors of infection: <b>Blood</b>, <b>Contact</b>, and <b>Airborne</b>. Diseases generally always can spread through blood, but they may also have either one, or even both of the other vectors. Science Goggles allow you to visualize those vectors, at the cost of making everything look purple.</p>
				<p>Getting infected through <b>Blood</b> occurs from injections, drinking infected blood, or eating meat from a diseased <i>animal</i>. Additionally, if you're getting splashed with blood on areas of your body that are bleeding themselves, an infection can occur.</p>
				<p>Getting infected through <b>Contact</b> occurs from touching, punching, bumping between two individuals. Getting splashed with blood that also have the Contact spread vector may cause an infection. On top of that, when picking up an item, there is a chance to transmit the infection to the item, where it'll remain for a few minutes. Picking up or getting hit by an infected item can also infect you. Keep all of that in mind when doing surgery, as most tools are not sterile. A quick spray of space cleaner over infected items is all it takes to remove the pathogen.</p>
				<p>Getting infected through the <b>Air</b> occurs from breathing a pathogenic cloud, emitted by another infected individual, an open growth dish, or some other occurrences.</p>
				<p>Also keep in mind that blood, vomit, sputum, or mucus laying on the floor can all be pathogen carriers. Standing over them can infect you if you're not wearing appropriate protection depending on the pathogen's vectors.</p>
				<p>To protect yourself from diseases with the Airborne vector, anything sterile that covers your mouth will work: a sterile mask, a bio hood, a space helmet, internals (connected to an appropriate air tank)</p>
				<p>To protect yourself from diseases with the Contact vector, keep in mind that it all depends on which areas of your body enter in contact. For instance, when you bump into someone, your <b>hands</b> will touch their <b>torso</b>, so wearing latex gloves is sufficient. However if THEY bump into you and aren't wearing gloves, you should wear a bio suit to protect your torso. All clothing have a bit of sterility, but doctor clothing usually have a fairly decent level of protection. Keeping your labcoat's buttons closed also helps a fair bit.</p>
				<a href="#menu">Table of Contents</a>
				<h3 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: Acquiring pathogenic Samples</h3>
				<p>If you work for a megacorporation like NanoTrasen, chances are that there are some growth dishes lying in the virology lab waiting to be analyzed. It's nice to keep you busy for a while, but you might want to work on different forms of pathogens, or ones with a completely different symptoms without having to wait for ages while incubating mutagen.</p>
				<p>A first solution is to pass an order at your local Cargo bay for some disease dishes. Each crate is usually fitted with 4 new dishes to work with</p>
				<p><b>Note, however, that dishes that come from either Virology or Cargo tend to have relatively high strength, making them more complicated to cure for the uninitiated, and also a problem for the crew if they have dangerous symptoms, which they often have. So if you value your job (and your head) do not allow those diseases to get loose.</b></p>
				<p>Less dangerous diseases are generally fairly easy to come by. Crew members occasionally arrive with a cold or a flu, mice also tend to carry diseases. All you need is a blood sample, <b>the Isolation Centrifuge lets you print sample dishes from any infected blood you give to it</b>. Remember to keep the vials balanced so the isolation process takes as little time as possible.</p>
				<p>Lastly, viral outbreaks may occur even without a containment failure. Whether from some bacteria that can survive through space, or an invasion of Black Plague Mice, or some Xenoarchaeologist brought back some artifact that generates pathogenic clouds. When then happens, you NEED to acquire a sample of it as quickly as possible, analyze it so that infected people show up on medical HUDs, and synthesize a vaccine to be distributed in medbay lobby.</p>
				<a href="#menu">Table of Contents</a>
				<h3 id="chapter3">Chapter 3: Incubating and Analyzing Samples</h3>
				<p>Growth dishes have a distinctive color and pattern depending on the disease in it. This color may slightly change after an effect mutation, and the pattern becomes more visible as the dish's growth rises. After acquiring a new growth dish, you generally want to open its lid (after wearing latex gloves and a sterile mask) add some virus food to it, and insert it in the Pathogenic Incubator, then turn it on.</p>
				<p>(Also keep in mind that Virology machinery is quite taxing on power, so turn off machines that you aren't using.)</p>
				<p>Incubators use radiation to cause pathogens to react to various reagents. The following reactions are known to occur:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Virus Food(0.2u): <b>Increases Dish Growth</b>
				<li>Water(0.2u): <b>Decreases Dish Growth</b> (not that you'd have any reason to do that)
				<li>Mutagen(0.05u): <b>(MAJOR) Effect Mutation</b>, small chance to cause an effect to be randomized with another effect.
				<li>Radium(0.02u): <b>(MAJOR) Antigen Mutation</b>, very small chance to cause the disease's antigen to change.
				<li>Creatine(0.05u): <b>(minor) Strengthening</b>, chance to increase the disease's strength.
				<li>Spaceacillin(0.05u): <b>(minor)  Weakening</b>, chance to weaken the disease's strength.
				<li>Mutagen(0.5u)+Creatine(0.5u): <b>(minor) Effect and Robustness Strengthening</b>, slightly increases the strength of all individual effects
				<li>Mutagen(0.5u)+Spaceacillin(0.5u): <b>(minor) Effect and Robustness Weakening</b>, slightly decreases the strength of all individual effects
				</ul>
				<p>Reactions that share reagents will not occure at the same time. Combination reactions will occur in priority (for instance, if there is 5u of mutagen and 5u of creatine in your dish, only Robustness Strengthening will occur, and no Effect Mutation nor Strengthening will occur).</p>
				<p>The green gauge displayed next to the dish lets you keep track of it's current growth level. The lights underneath, from left to right turn on as follow:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Green: Dish Growth at 100%
				<li>Red: Dish has no more reagent
				<li>Purple: Dish has had a major mutation occur
				<li>Blue: Dish has had a minor mutation occur
				</ul>
				<p><b>Incubation also has a chance to occur in individuals irradiated to dangerous levels, however should an Effect Mutation occur this way, it has been observed that the new effect would have a similar danger to the original one, thankfully.</b></p>
				<p>At 100% growth, the dish can be removed from the incubator and analyzed.</p>
				<p>Simply place it on the Analyser and operate it. The process is very quick, but requires you to remain adjacent. After the process is done, the following occurs:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>a sticker appears on the dish that you can examine and that lets you check what is the disease's information, such as quick descriptions of its effects or its antigens
				<li>this information is also added to the Pathogen Database which you can edit, and also give the disease a Nickname or set it's dangerousness.
				<li>diseases analysed this way will now show up on medical HUDs, the icon will depend on the dangerousness set in the database.
				<li>their ID and name will appear in the results of scans from Health Analyzer, Immunity Scanner, and they will be recognized by other virology machines.
				</ul>
				<p>If a dish that was already analyzed had a major mutation, and you analyze it again, it will register in the Database under a separate entry, with a child ID.</p>
				<p>Among the data stored, the following information is the most important:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><b>Strength</b>: This is the antibody concentration required for the body to get rid of the pathogen. Lower values mean the disease will easily be cured with spaceacillin alone.
				<li><b>Robustness</b>: This is the percentage of the strength at which the stronger effects will start getting muted. The numbers in parenthesis next to it indicate the specific concentrations at which the effects will be muted. So for example, if your body has 50% antibody concentration, and the disease has a Strength of 51%, and a Robustness bellow 90%, you will carry the disease WITHOUT seeing any of its effects yourself.
				<li><b>Infection Chance</b>: Whenever there is a window of opportunity for a vector to infect you, and it manages to get through any clothing or other protections due to insufficient sterility, this is the chance percentage that you will be infected by the disease. Additionally, Pathogenic Clouds emitted will travel much further and be more numerous if the Infection chance is high, and infected items will remain infected for a longer duration.
				<li><b>Progress Speed</b>: The percentage chance that a disease will progress to the next stage after it has been present in a body for long enough.
				</ul>
				<p>Additionally, the following information is relevant to the disease's effects:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><b>Stage</b>: This is the stage from which the effect may trigger.
				<li><b>Danger</b>: A value from 0 (helpful) to 5 (deadly) indicating how much of a boon or an inconvenience a symptom can be.
				<li><b>Strength</b>: Specific to each effect, check the Symptom Encyclopedia for more details.
				<li><b>Occurrence</b>: The percentage chance that the effect will occur at every second when the stage has been reached. Some effects can have this value altered randomly following a Robustness alteration reaction during incubation.
				</ul>
				<a href="#menu">Table of Contents</a>
				<h3 id="chapter4">Chapter 4: Pathogen Modification</h3>
				<p>As explained in the previous chapter, with a few chemicals and an incubator, you can alter a pathogen to some degree. Keep in mind though that there is currently no way to change a pathogen's form (a Virus won't magically become a Bacteria) or their spread vectors. Here are the following default characteristics of each forms:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><b>Virus</b>: 4 stages, High infection chance, Very Low Progress Speed, stage reduced by 1 after an infection, can kill weaker Bacteria
				<li><b>Bacteria</b>: 3 stages, Very High infection chance, Low Progress Speed, stage reduced back to 1 after an infection, can kill weaker Parasite
				<li><b>Parasite</b>: 4 stages, Average infection chance, Very Low Progress Speed, stage is not reduced after an infection, can kill weaker Virus
				<li><b>Prion</b>: 4 stages, Very Low infection chance, Very High Progress Speed, stage reduced back to 1 after an infection, cannot kill any pathogen
				</ul>
				<p>However, as a virologist, you will want to shape a pathogen with very specific effects and values in mind. That's where the Disease Splicer comes in. This computer can scan (and destroy in the process) dishes to extract GNA disks, containing the gene data of an effect, including its current strength and occurrence. These disks can then be swiped anytime on the Disease Splicer to re-add it to the computer's buffer.</p>
				<p>You may then splice the buffered effect into any other dish, letting you create the desired pathogen, one effect at a time.</p>
				<p>When removing a modified dish from the computer, it will be automatically and instantly re-analysed, adding the new modified pathogen to the database.</p>
				<a href="#menu">Table of Contents</a>
				<h3 id="chapter5">Chapter 5: Overview of the Various Cures and the Immune System</h3>
				<p>While the Preambule takes a laconic approach to the topic of curing diseases, this chapter will go more into depths. For starters there are 5 ways to remove a disease from a body:</p>
				<ol>
				<li><b>Antipathogenics</b>. Pros: work on every diseases regardless of antigen, very efficient at getting rid of weak diseases Cons: works relatively slowly, most antipathogenics cannot efficiently reach 100% antibody concentration making them unable to cure the strongest diseases, stronger antipathogenics have nasty overdose reactions.
				<li><b>Vaccine</b>. Pros: can be taken preemptively to prevent infection altogether, takes effect very quickly. Cons: Requires antipathogenics and time to produce, can only target specific antigens making it hard to acquire vaccine for rare antigen (X, Y, Z) before an outbreak.
				<li><b>Radium Overload</b>. Pros: very straightforward, works fairly quickly. Cons: causes lots of toxin damage over the body, destroys the immune system which prevents antipathogenics or vaccines to ever work again, and most importantly can only be done once.
				<li><b>Pathogenic Warfare</b>. Pros: Can work even on people who no longer have an immune system, quite neat to watch those pathogens kill each others. Cons: Requires access to specific forms, raising strength while keeping the cure pathogen harmless takes time, cannot be used against Prions.
				<li><b>Cooking the body at over a thousand Kelvin</b>. Pros: It works at killing EVERYTHING in your body, unsurprisingly. Cons: You have to reach a certain level of desperation to even consider this option.
				</ol>
				<p>Spaceacillin should never be taken in doses of 15u or more, as you risk to overdose. A stronger variant, Nanofloxacin, obtained by mixing Spaceacillin with Nanobots and Fluorine, is so potent that it can easily cure even the strongest diseases, but should never be taken in doses of more than 2u.</p>
				<p>When doing a Radium Overload, the patient will often vomit just before getting rid of the disease, and the vomit might contain said diseases, so have them wear a biosuit first so they don't immediately get re-infected with littly hope of getting cured.</p>
				<p>A last resort to cure a body is to simple create a clone. But keep in mind that newly cloned individuals will have a temporarily weakend immune system. It'll take about two minutes for their immune system to be again at full strength.</p>
				<a href="#menu">Table of Contents</a>
				<h3 id="chapter6">Afterword: On your Purpose as Virologist</h3>
				<p>As a Virologist, a Microbiologist, or a Pathologist, your work priorities are as follow by order of importance:</p>
				<ol>
				<li>Curing any ongoing outbreaks
				<li>Isolating and analyzing any disease that you can get your hands on
				<li>Producing vaccines from as many distinct antibodies as possible in preparation for future outbreaks
				<li>Inducing mutations in dishes to acquire new effects and save them to GNA disks
				<li>Use said disks to engineer new interesting diseases
				</ol>
				<p>With all the slots in the incubator, and the centrifuge, you can easily work on several of those tasks in parallel.</p>
				<p>Remember to keep good relationships with the rest of the medical team, so they can trust you to be reliable when needed.</p>
				<p>Also remember that as you are still technically a doctor, if there is an influx of patients, it should be welcome of you to come give your colleagues a hand.</p>
				<p>Lastly on that point about interesting diseases, what you do with said diseases, keep in mind that you are NOT to distribute diseases outside of medbay without control. Release of engineered beneficial pathogen should be supervised by the Chief Medical Officer, and limited to medbay at the beginning. Never release a pathogen that you don't have the cure to, and do NOT sell pathogen to Vox Traders or Syndicate Agents, as you'll be held accountable for any casualty caused by a subsequent uncontrolled release of the pathogen.</p>
