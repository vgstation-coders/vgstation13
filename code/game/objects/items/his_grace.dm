//His Grace is a very special weapon granted only to traitor chaplains.
//When awakened, He thirsts for blood and begins ticking a "bloodthirst" counter.
//The wielder of His Grace is immune to stuns and gradually heals.
//If the wielder fails to feed His Grace in time, He will devour them and become incredibly aggressive.
//Leaving His Grace alone for some time will reset His thirst and put Him to sleep.
//Using His Grace effectively requires extreme speed and care.
