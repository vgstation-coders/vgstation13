/*
 * Why have simple atom generation when you can have complex atom generation ?
 * Instead of placing individual items at random, we have a much smaller chance of placing "generation seeds"
 * Once that's down, tiles in a certain radius follow complex seeding rules
 * Can be used to make anything. Small forest zones, lakes, murder zones, debris, generic clutter, mob groups, etc
 * Supports objects and mobs (under movable) and turfs. Only one at a time, though (mobs and objects can be mixed, but should be mixed, carefully)
 * Note that it only supports random and radial generation. Anything more complex will need an even more complex and specific generator
 * While this generator supports all three types at once, it will try to spawn all three types at once
