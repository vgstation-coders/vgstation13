At 7:30 AM on March 8th, 2017, ArcLumin died in a fatal car crash on impact.
Rest in peace, man. You did good work.
When a contributor for SS13 dies, all codebases feel it and suffer.
We may disagree on whether farts should be a thing, or what color to paint the bikeshed,
but we are all contributors together.

Goodbye, man. We'll miss you.

This memorial has been designed for him and any future coders to perish.
