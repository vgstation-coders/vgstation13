/*
 * TODO:
 * Decide if we need fingerprints on this obj
 * Decide which other mob can use this
 * Sprite bar sign that is destroyed
 * Sprite bar sign that is unpowered
 * Add this obj to power consumers
 * Decide how much power this uses
 * Make this constructable with a decided step how to construct it
 * Make this deconstructable with a decided step how to deconstruct it
 * Decide what materials are used for this obj
 * Logic for area because it's a two tile consuming obj
 * Is this obj can be emagged? if yes what can be the trace that this obj is emagged?
 *									(I suggest broken ID authentication wiring)
 * Need more frames for existing bar signs (icons/obj/barsigns.dmi)
 * An ID scanner that will makes sound and
 *		output something that's the access has been granted
