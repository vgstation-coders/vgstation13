	/*
	Should be expanded.
	How this works:
	Instead of "I'm looking for James Smith," the traitor would say "James Smith" as part of a conversation.
	Another traitor may then respond with: "They enjoy running through the void-filled vacuum of the derelict."
	The phrase should then have the words: James Smith.
	The response should then have the words: run, void, and derelict.
	This way assures that the code is suited to the conversation and is unpredicatable.
	Obviously, some people will be better at this than others but in theory, everyone should be able to do it and it only enhances roleplay.
	Can probably be done through "{ }" but I don't really see the practical benefit.
	One example of an earlier system is commented below.
