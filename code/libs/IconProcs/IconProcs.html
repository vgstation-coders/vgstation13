<h1>IconProcs</h1>
<p class="subtitle">A BYOND library for manipulating icons and colors</p>
<p class="author">by Lummox JR</p>
<p class="version">version 1.0</p>


<p>The IconProcs library was made to make a lot of common icon operations much
easier. BYOND's icon manipulation routines are very capable but some of the
advanced capabilities like using alpha transparency can be unintuitive to
beginners.</p>



<h2>Changing Icons</h2>

<p>Several new procs have been added to the <tt>/icon</tt> datum to simplify
working with icons. To use them, remember you first need to setup an
<tt>/icon</tt> var like so:</p>

<pre>var/icon/my_icon = new('iconfile.dmi')</pre>

<dl>

<dt><tt>icon/ChangeOpacity(amount = 1)</tt></dt>
<dd>A very common operation in DM is to try to make an icon more or less
transparent. Making an icon more transparent is usually much easier than making
it less so, however. This proc basically is a frontend for <tt>MapColors()</tt>
which can change opacity any way you like, in much the same way that
<tt>SetIntensity()</tt> can make an icon lighter or darker. If <tt>amount</tt>
is 0.5, the opacity of the icon will be cut in half. If <tt>amount</tt> is 2,
opacity is doubled and anything more than half-opaque will become fully
opaque.</dd>

<dt><tt>icon/GrayScale()</tt></dt>
<dd>Converts the icon to grayscale instead of a fully colored icon. Alpha
values are left intact.</dd>

<dt><tt>icon/ColorTone(tone)</tt></dt>
<dd>Similar to <tt>GrayScale()</tt>, this proc converts the icon to a range of
black -&gt; <tt>tone</tt> -&gt; white, where <tt>tone</tt> is an RGB color (its
alpha is ignored). This can be used to create a sepia tone or similar effects.
See also the global <tt>ColorTone()</tt> proc.</dd>

<dt><tt>icon/MinColors(icon)</tt></dt>
<dd>The icon is blended with a second icon where the minimum of each RGB pixel
is the result. Transparency may increase, as if the icons were blended with
<tt>ICON_ADD</tt>. You may supply a color in place of an icon.</dd>

<dt><tt>icon/MaxColors(icon)</tt></dt>
<dd>The icon is blended with a second icon where the maximum of each RGB pixel
is the result. Opacity may increase, as if the icons were blended with
<tt>ICON_OR</tt>. You may supply a color in place of an icon.</dd>

<dt><tt>icon/Opaque(background = "#000000")</tt></dt>
<dd>All alpha values are set to 255 throughout the icon. Transparent pixels
become black, or whatever background color you specify.</dd>

<dt><tt>icon/BecomeAlphaMask()</tt></dt>
<dd>You can convert a simple grayscale icon into an alpha mask to use with other
icons very easily with this proc. The black parts become transparent, the
white parts stay white, and anything in between becomes a translucent shade of
white.</dd>

<dt><tt>icon/AddAlphaMask(mask)</tt></dt>
<dd>The alpha values of the mask icon will be blended with the current icon.
Anywhere the mask is opaque, the current icon is untouched. Anywhere the mask
is transparent, the current icon becomes transparent. Where the mask is
translucent, the current icon becomes more transparent.</dd>

<dt><tt>icon/UseAlphaMask(mask, mode)</tt></dt>
<dd>Sometimes you may want to take the alpha values from one icon and use them
on a different icon. This proc will do that. Just supply the icon whose alpha
mask you want to use, and <tt>src</tt> will change so it has the same colors
as before but uses the mask for opacity.</dd>

</dl>


<h2>Color management and HSV</h2>

<p>RGB isn't the only way to represent color. Sometimes it's more useful to
work with a model called HSV, which stands for hue, saturation, and value.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <b>hue</b> of a color describes where it is along the color wheel. It goes from red to yellow to green to cyan to blue to magenta and back to red.</li>
  <li>The <b>saturation</b> of a color is how much color is in it. A color with low saturation will be more gray, and with no saturation at all it <i>is</i> a shade of gray.</li>
  <li>The <b>value</b> of a color determines how bright it is. A high-value color is vivid, moderate value is dark, and no value at all is black.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just as BYOND uses <tt>"#rrggbb"</tt> to represent RGB values, a similar
format is used for HSV: <tt>"#hhhssvv"</tt>. The hue is three hex digits
because it ranges from 0 to 0x5FF.</p>

<ul>
  <li>0 to 0xFF - red to yellow</li>
  <li>0x100 to 0x1FF - yellow to green</li>
  <li>0x200 to 0x2FF - green to cyan</li>
  <li>0x300 to 0x3FF - cyan to blue</li>
  <li>0x400 to 0x4FF - blue to magenta</li>
  <li>0x500 to 0x5FF - magenta to red</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing this, you can figure out that red is <tt>"#000ffff"</tt> in HSV
format, which is hue 0 (red), saturation 255 (as colorful as possible), value
255 (as bright as possible). Green is <tt>"#200ffff"</tt> and blue is
<tt>"#400ffff"</tt>.</p>

<p>More than one HSV color can match the same RGB color.</p>

<p>Here are some procs you can use for color management:</p>


<dl>

<dt><tt>ReadRGB(rgb)</tt></dt>
<dd>Takes an RGB string like <tt>"#ffaa55"</tt> and converts it to a list such
as <tt>list(255,170,85)</tt>. If an RGBA format is used that includes alpha,
the list will have a fourth item for the alpha value.</dd>

<dt><tt>hsv(hue, sat, val, apha)</tt></dt>
<dd>Counterpart to <tt>rgb()</tt>, this takes the values you input and converts
them to a string in <tt>"#hhhssvv"</tt> or <tt>"#hhhssvvaa"</tt> format. Alpha
is not included in the result if null.</dd>

<dt><tt>ReadHSV(rgb)</tt></dt>
<dd>Takes an HSV string like <tt>"#100FF80"</tt> and converts it to a list such
as <tt>list(256,255,128)</tt>. If an HSVA format is used that includes alpha,
the list will have a fourth item for the alpha value.</dd>

<dt><tt>RGBtoHSV(rgb)</tt></dt>
<dd>Takes an RGB or RGBA string like <tt>"#ffaa55"</tt> and converts it into an
HSV or HSVA color such as <tt>"#080aaff"</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>HSVtoRGB(hsv)</tt></dt>
<dd>Takes an HSV or HSVA string like <tt>"#080aaff"</tt> and converts it into
an RGB or RGBA color such as <tt>"#ff55aa"</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>BlendRGB(rgb1, rgb2, amount)</tt></dt>
<dd>Blends between two RGB or RGBA colors using regular RGB blending. If
<tt>amount</tt> is 0, the first color is the result; if 1, the second color is
the result. 0.5 produces an average of the two. Values outside the 0 to 1 range
are allowed as well. The returned value is an RGB or RGBA color.</dd>

<dt><tt>BlendHSV(hsv1, hsv2, amount)</tt></dt>
<dd>Blends between two HSV or HSVA colors using HSV blending, which tends to
produce nicer results than regular RGB blending because the brightness of the
color is left intact. If <tt>amount</tt> is 0, the first color is the result;
if 1, the second color is the result. 0.5 produces an average of the two.
Values outside the 0 to 1 range are allowed as well. The returned value is an
HSV or HSVA color.</dd>

<dt><tt>BlendRGBasHSV(rgb1, rgb2, amount)</tt></dt>
<dd>Like <tt>BlendHSV()</tt>, but the colors used and the return value are RGB
or RGBA colors. The blending is done in HSV form.</dd>

<dt><tt>HueToAngle(hue)</tt></dt>
<dd>Converts a hue to an angle range of 0 to 360. Angle 0 is red, 120 is green,
and 240 is blue.</dd>

<dt><tt>AngleToHue(hue)</tt></dt>
<dd>Converts an angle to a hue in the valid range.</dd>

<dt><tt>RotateHue(hsv, angle)</tt></dt>
<dd>Takes an HSV or HSVA value and rotates the hue forward through red, green,
and blue by an angle from 0 to 360. (Rotating red by 60&deg; produces yellow.)
The result is another HSV or HSVA color with the same saturation and value as
the original, but a different hue.</dd>

<dt><tt>GrayScale(rgb)</tt></dt>
<dd>Takes an RGB or RGBA color and converts it to grayscale. Returns an RGB or
RGBA string.</dd>

<dt><tt>ColorTone(rgb, tone)</tt></dt>
<dd>Similar to <tt>GrayScale()</tt>, this proc converts an RGB or RGBA color to
a range of black -&gt; <tt>tone</tt> -&gt; white instead of using strict shades
of gray. The <tt>tone</tt> value is an RGB color; any alpha value is
ignored.</dd>
