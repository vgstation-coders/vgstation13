//How to create a new vault:
//1) create a map in maps/randomVaults/
//2) create a new subtype of /datum/map_element/vault/ (look below for an example) and set its file_path to your map's file path (including the file extension, which is most likely ".dmm")
//3) if you're an advanced user, feel free to play around with other variables
