//Vaults are structures that are randomly spawned as a part of the main map
//They're stored in maps/randomVaults/ as .dmm files

//HOW TO ADD YOUR OWN VAULTS:
//1. make a map in the maps/randomVaults/ folder (1 zlevel only please)
//2. add the map's name to the vault_map_names list
//3. the game will handle the rest

#define MINIMUM_VAULT_AMOUNT 1 //Amount of guaranteed vault spawns

//#define SPAWN_ALL_VAULTS //Uncomment to spawn all existing vaults (otherwise only some will spawn)!

//List of spawnable vaults is in code/modules/randomMaps/vault_definitions.dm

/area/random_vault
	name = "random vault area"
	desc = "Spawn a vault in there somewhere"
	icon_state = "random_vault"

//Because areas are shit and it's easier that way!

//Each of these areas can only create ONE vault. Only using /area/random_vault/v1 for the entire map will result in ONE vault being created.
//Placing them over (or even near) shuttle docking ports will sometimes result in a vault spawning on top of a shuttle docking port. This isn't a big problem, since
//shuttles can destroy the vaults, but it's better to avoid that
//If you want more vaults, feel free to add more subtypes of /area/random_vault. You don't have to add these subtypes to any lists or anything - just map it and the game will handle the rest.

//"/area/random_vault" DOESN'T spawn any vaults!!!
