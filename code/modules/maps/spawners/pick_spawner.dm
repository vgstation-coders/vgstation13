//
// PICK_SPAWNERS
//
// These work the same as regular map spawners, except that you place many of them and only ONE will be picked to spawn.
// They have a required category field (which is a string). By default, only one successful spawn is allowed per category.
//
// Example: You want to spawn 1 pair of insulated gloves in a room, but you want to randomize in which tile they will spawn.
// For this purpose, you would create a pickspawner that spawns 1 pair of insulated gloves, and give it a new, unique category like "yellowgloves_myroomname".
// You then place that same pickspawner 5 times in 5 different tiles. When the game loads, the gloves will randomly spawn in 1 out of those 5 possible locations.
// If you want to add a second pair of insulated gloves in a DIFFERENT room, you need a new pickspawner with a fresh category, like "yellowgloves_myotherroom".
//
// Technically, you can have multiple subtypes of pickspawner with different functionality but the same category.
// For example, you can make a "maint bear" pickspawner, a "space carp" pickspawner, and a "morgue spider" pickspawner, and give them all the same category.
// In that case, even though they do very different things and are in different places, only 1 will spawn regardless.
// This is OK, just make sure that's what you actually want to do (and make sure all pickspawners sharing an category have the same number for var/spawners_to_pick)
