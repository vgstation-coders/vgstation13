/*	TODO:
	Let them evolve and heal from eating. Should a carbon they eat go over a certain damage threshold and
	the wendigo is at full health. Strip and delete the corpse.
	Human wendigo->1 eat->Wendigo->3 eat->Alpha Wendigo (Can only be ONE at any time)
	They don't like fire. Will stay away from fire (As far as their light radius -1) and won't target anyone
	in vicinity of said fire
	Can mimic voices, steal poly code, and change it (Maybe just keep a log of people consumed,
	and use their name plus shout for help)
	Butcherable for one piece of meat only. When consumed (Don't use reagents) will begin to turn the person
