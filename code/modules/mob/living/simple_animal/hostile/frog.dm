//HOPPER LEGIONARIES
//Weak and slow hostile mobs (30 hp, 1-10 damage)
//- Can use spears: they can grab spears from the floor and use them in melee combat (boosting melee damage to respectable 10-18), as well as throw them
//- Ability to leap: when not holding a spear, they can leap on top of their enemies and hold onto them. While holding onto an enemy, they attack twice and gain a 10% chance of stunning them with each primary attack (double attack doesn't stun)
//Starts without a spear

//HOPPER CENTURIONS
//Like legionaries, but start with one spear.

//HOPPER JAVELINEERS
//Like centurions, but start with 5 spears and try to run away from their enemies, bombarding them with spears
