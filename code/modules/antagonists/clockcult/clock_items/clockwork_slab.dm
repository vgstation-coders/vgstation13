			they become a full-fledged Servant, ready and willing to serve the cause of Ratvar. It should also be noted that <i>silicon crew, such as cyborgs and the AI, can be \
			converted just like normal crew</i> and will gain special abilities; this is covered later. This section will also cover converting the station's structure itself; walls, \
			floors, windows, tables, and other objects can all be converted into clockwork versions, and serve an important purpose.<br><br>"
			dat += "<font color=#BE8700><b>A Note on Geis:</b></font> There are several ways to convert humans and silicons. However, the most important tool to making them work is \
			<b>Geis</b>, a Driver-tier scripture. Using it whispers an invocation very quickly and charges your slab with power. In addition to <i>making the slab visible in your hand,</i> \
			you can now use it on a target within melee range to bind and mute them. It is by far your most reliable tool for capturing potential converts and targets, though it is incredibly \
			obvious. In addition, you are unable to take any actions other than moving while your target is bound. The binding will last for 25 seconds and mute for about 13 seconds, though \
			allies can use Geis to refresh these effects.<br><br>"
			dat += "<font color=#BE8700><b>Converting:</b></font> The two methods of conversion are the <b>sigil of submission</b>, whose purpose is to do so, and the <b>mania motor.</b> \
			The sigil of submission is a sigil that, when stood on by a non-Servant for eight seconds, will convert that non-Servant. This is the only practical way to convert targets. \
			Sigils of submission are cheap, early, and permanent! Make sure sigils of submission are placed only in bases or otherwise hidden spots, or with a sigil of transgression on them. \
			The mania motor, however, is generally unreliable and unlocked later, only converting those who stand near it for an extended period.<br><br>"
			dat += "<font color=#BE8700><b>Converting Humans:</b></font> For obvious reasons, humans are the most common conversion target. Because every crew member is different, and \
			may be armed with different equipment, you should take precautions to ensure that they aren't able to resist. If able, removing a headset is essential, as is restraining \
			them through handcuffs, cable ties, or other restraints. Some crew, like security, are also implanted with mindshield implants; these will prevent conversion and must be \
			surgically removed before they are an eligible convert. <i>Note:</i> The captain is <i>never</i> an eligible convert and should instead be killed or imprisoned. If security \
			begins administering mindshield implants, this will greatly inhibit conversion. Also note that mindshield implants can be broken by a sigil of accession automatically, but \
			the sigil will disappear.<br><br>"
			dat += "<font color=#BE8700><b>Converting Silicons:</b></font> Due to their robotic nature, silicons are generally more predictable than humans in terms of conversion. \
			However, they are also much, much harder to subdue, especially cyborgs. The easiest way to convert a cyborg is by using Geis to restrain them, then dragging them to a sigil \
			of submission. If you stack a sigil of transgression and a sigil of submission, a crossing cyborg will be stunned and helpless to escape before they are converted.<br><br>"
			dat += "Converting AIs is very often the hardest task of the cult, and has been the downfall of countless successful Servants. Their omnipresence across the station, \
			coupled with their secure location and ability to lock themselves securely, makes them a powerful target. However, once the AI itself is reached, it is usually completely \
			helpless to resist its own conversion. A very common tactic is to take advantage of a converted cyborg to rush the AI before it is able to react.<br><br>"
			dat += "Even once an AI is converted, care must be taken to ensure that it remains hidden. Not only does the AI's core become brassy and thus obvious to an outside \
			observer, but <i>the AI loses the ability to speak in anything but Ratvarian.</i> For this reason, it has to remain completely silent over common radio channels if stealth \
			is at all a priority. This is suspicious and will rapidly lead to the crew checking on it, which usually results in the cult's outing. It is, however, necessary to convert \
			all AIs present on the station before the Ark becomes invokable, so this must be done at some point.<br><br>"
			dat += "<font color=#BE8700><b>Converting the Station:</b></font> Converted objects all serve a purpose and are important to the cult's success. To convert objects, \
			a Servant needs to use a <b>replica fabricator,</b> a handheld tool that uses power to replace objects with clockwork versions. Different clockwork objects have different \
			effects and are often crucial. The most noteworthy are <b>clockwork walls,</b> which automatically \"link\" to any nearby Tinkerer's Caches, causing them to <b>slowly \
			generate components.</b> This is incredibly useful for obvious reasons, and creating a clockwork wall near every Tinkerer's Cache should be prioritized. Clockwork floors \
			will slowly heal any toxin damage suffered by Servants standing on them, and clockwork airlocks can only be opened by Servants.<br><br>"
			dat += "The replica fabricator itself is also worth noting. In addition to replacing objects, it can also create brass sheets at the cost of power by using the \
			fabricator in-hand. It can also be used to repair any damaged clockwork structures.<br><br>"
			dat += "Replacing objects is almost as, if not as important as, converting new Servants. A base is impossible to manage without clockwork walls at the very least, and \
			once the cult has been outed and the crew are actively searching, there is little reason not to use as many as possible.<br><br>"
