The Ratvarian Language
	In the lore of the Servants of Ratvar, the Ratvarian tongue is a timeless language and full of power. It sounds like gibberish, much like Nar-Sie's language, but is in fact derived from
aforementioned language, and may induce miracles when spoken in the correct way with an amplifying tool (similar to runes used by the Nar-Sian cult).

	While the canon states that the language of Ratvar and his servants is incomprehensible to the unenlightened as it is a derivative of the most ancient known language, in reality it is
actually very simple. To translate a plain English sentence to Ratvar's tongue, simply move all of the letters thirteen places ahead, starting from "a" if the end of the alphabet is reached.
This cipher is known as "rot13" for "rotate 13 places" and there are many sites online that allow instant translation between English and rot13 - one of the benefits is that moving the translated
sentence thirteen places ahead changes it right back to plain English.

	There are, however, a few parts of the Ratvarian tongue that aren't typical and are implemented for fluff reasons. Some words may have graves, or hyphens (prefix and postfix), making the plain
English translation apparent but disjoined (for instance, "Orubyq zl-cbjre!" translates directly to "Behold my-power!") although this can be ignored without impacting overall quality. When
translating from Ratvar's tongue to plain English, simply remove the disjointments and use the finished sentence. This would make "Orubyq zl-cbjre!" into "Behold my power!" after removing the
abnormal spacing, hyphens, and grave accents.

List of nuances:
- Any time the WORD "of" occurs, it is linked to the previous word by a hyphen. (i.e. "V nz-bs Ratvar." directly translates to "I am-of Ratvar.")
- Any time "th", followed by any two letters occurs, you add a grave (`) between those two letters, i.e; "Thi`s"
- In the same vein, any time "ti", followed by one letter occurs, you add a grave (`) between "i" and the letter, i.e; "Ti`me"
- Whereever "te" or "et" appear and there is another letter next to the e(i.e; "m"etal, greate"r"), add a hyphen between "e" and the letter, i.e; "M-etal", "Greate-r"
- Where "gua" appears, add a hyphen between "gu" and "a", i.e "Gu-ard"
- Where the WORD "and" appears it is linked to all surrounding words by hyphens, i.e; "Sword-and-shield"
- Where the WORD "to" appears, it is linked to the following word by a hyphen, i.e; "to-use"
- Where the WORD "my" appears, it is linked to the following word by a hyphen, i.e; "my-light"
- Although "Ratvar" translates to "Engine" in English, the word "Ratvar" is used regardless of language as it is a proper noun.
 - The same rule applies to Ratvar's four generals: Nezbere (Armorer), Sevtug (Fright), Nzcrentr (Amperage), and Inath-neq (Vangu-Ard), although these words can be used in proper context if one is
   not referring to the four generals and simply using the words themselves.
