/*
There are two ways to add an away mission to the game

 A) Add the map file's location to maps/RandomZLevels/fileList.txt
 B) Create a subtype of /datum/map_element/away_mission and set its file_path to the map file's location (see below)

First method sucks

Second method lets you use the initialize() proc to interact with the away mission after it has loaded (for example generate map elements, create shuttles, etc).
It also lets you write a description for the away mission, as well as many other things

Example of the second method:

/datum/map_element/away_mission/my_shit
	file_path = "maps/RandomZLevels/fresh_dump.dmm"
	desc = "This stinks"

****READ THIS****
  Because a z-level is 500x500 in size, loading an away mission creates 250,000 new turfs - in addition to any additonal mobs and objects.

  If your away mission is smaller than 500x500, its northern and eastern borders will be surrounded with space turfs. Unless you're fine with this, you
 should secure these borders with an indestructible wall (insert a trump meme here) so that nobody can get out
