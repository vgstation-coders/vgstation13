// Huge, huge, immense thanks to Nandrew of the BYOND forums for posting their demo of the new lighting methods, upon which
// this is being built! Thread can be found at the following address: // http://www.byond.com/forum/?post=2033630 (hopefully).
// Additional thanks to Mloc, whose previous work a lot of this draws on, PJ and ErikHanson, for advice and assistance,
// BordListian on Reddit for more advice and discussion, and whoever else was involved that I have forgotten.
// Also thanks to Lummox for BYOND 510's awesome new features.
