/*****************************
 * /vg/station In-Game Store *
 *****************************

By Nexypoo

The idea is to give people who do their jobs a reward.

Ideally, these items should be cosmetic in nature to avoid fucking up round balance.
People joining the round get between $100 and $500.  Keep this in mind.

Money should not persist between rounds, although a "bank" system to voluntarily store
money between rounds might be cool.  It'd need to be a bit volatile:  perhaps completing
job objectives = good stock market, shitty job objective completion = shitty economy.

Goal for now is to get the store itself working, however.
