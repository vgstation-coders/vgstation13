// IDEAL USE FOR WIZARD EMA- I MEAN, ARCADE TAMPER:
// -Emags are already used on electronic things, so try find as many non machinery items to apply this on, particularly ones with no foreseeable emag effect.
// -Keep ideas anomalous and sometimes absurd, if possible make the item do things it shouldn't even with hacking.
// -Usable items should generally be weakened by these, as a cursing wizard spell would.
