# Example usage:
# @SERVERNAME tgstation
# Which sets the SERVERNAME, and disallows admins from being able to change it using View Variables.
# @LOG_TWITTER 0
# Which explicitly disables LOG_TWITTER, as well as locking it.
# There are various options which are hard-locked for security reasons.

## Server name: This appears at the top of the screen in-game and in the BYOND hub. Uncomment and replace 'tgstation' with the name of your choice.
# SERVERNAME tgstation

## Server SQL name: This is the name used to identify the server to the SQL DB, distinct from SERVERNAME as it must be at most 32 characters.
# SERVERSQLNAME tgstation

## Station name: The name of the station as it is referred to in-game. If commented out, the game will generate a random name instead.

## REQUIRES the database set up to work. Keep it hashed if you don't have a database set up.
## NOTE: If you have just set-up the database keep this DISABLED, as player age is determined from the first time they connect to the server with the database up. If you just set it up, it means
## you have noone older than 0 days, since noone has been logged yet. Only turn this on once you have had the database up for 30 days.

## Map rotate chance delta
## This is the chance of map rotation factored to the round length.
## A value of 1 would mean the map rotation chance is the round length in minutes (hour long round == 60% rotation chance)

###Master Controller High Pop Mode###

##The Master Controller(MC) is the primary system controlling timed tasks and events in SS13 (lobby timer, game checks, lighting updates, atmos, etc)
##Default base MC tick rate (1 = process every "byond tick" (see: tick_lag/fps config settings), 2 = process every 2 byond ticks, etc)
##	Setting this to 0 will prevent the Master Controller from ticking
BASE_MC_TICK_RATE 1

##High population MC tick rate
##	Byond rounds timer values UP, but the tick rate is modified with heuristics during lag spites so setting this to something like 2
##	will make it run every 2 byond ticks, but will also double the effect of anti-lag heuristics. You can instead set it to something like
##	1.1 to make it run every 2 byond ticks, but only increase the effect of anti-lag heuristics by 10%. or 1.5 for 50%.
##	(As an aside, you could in theory also reduce the effect of anti-lag heuristics in the base tick rate by setting it to something like 0.5)
HIGH_POP_MC_TICK_RATE 1.1

##Engage high pop mode if player count raises above this (Player in this context means any connected user. Lobby, ghost or in-game all count)
HIGH_POP_MC_MODE_AMOUNT 65

##Disengage high pop mode if player count drops below this
DISABLE_HIGH_POP_MC_MODE_AMOUNT 60

## Uncomment to prevent the world from sleeping while no players are connected after initializations

## Uncomment to set the number of /world/Reboot()s before the DreamDaemon restarts itself. 0 means restart every round. Requires tgstation server tools.

##Default screen resolution, in tiles.
##	By default, this is 15x15, which gets simplified to 7 by BYOND, as it is a 1:1 screen ratio.
##	For reference, Goonstation uses a resolution of 21x15 for it's widescreen mode.
##	Do note that changing this value will affect the title screen. The title screen will have to be updated manually if this is changed.
DEFAULT_VIEW 15x15
