DMI Compile System
==========================

A (less) shitty hack by N3X15

WHY THE FUCK?
-------------

BYOND 499 limited the number of icon states that can be
added to a DMI to 512 states.  Why?  Who fucking knows.
Magically, DM can't edit them but the server doesn't
care how big they are, so it's probably a shitty hack
so they don't have to change the array's index type.

Whatever the case, we ran into this wall.  You cannot edit
items_lefthand and items_righthand with BYOND anymore.  We
filed a bug report: http://www.byond.com/forum/?post=1507331

They closed it with "Not a Bug".

So, here we are.  The only way to edit DMIs that big 
is with third-party tools like BYONDTools.

Compiled Files
--------------

Files that are currently compiled:

 * icons/mob/head.dmi - Built from icons/mob/head/
 * icons/mob/suit.dmi - Built from icons/mob/suit/
 * icons/mob/uniform.dmi - Built from icons/mob/uniform/
 * icons/mob/items_lefthand.dmi - Built from icons/mob/in-hand/left/
 * icons/mob/items_righthand.dmi - Built from icons/mob/in-hand/right/
 
To add new icon states to these files, add your state to the existing states, or add a new one.

Ideally, things that should be logically grouped together should be in their own DMI.

How to Compile
--------------

1. [Install BYONDTools](http://ss13.pomf.se/wiki/index.php/User:N3X15/Guide_to_BYONDTools).
2. Dump your DMIs into the appropriate folder. (Left-hand crap into the left-hand folder, etc.)
3. Open your command prompt. (cmd.exe on Windows)
4. Run the following (with the correct paths, of course):

```
cd path/to/vgstation13
dmi_compile
```

buildIcons.bat in the root folder of this repository will do steps 3-4 for you, if you're on Windows.

Adding More Output Targets
--------------------------

If you've run into the problem mentioned above with another DMI, have no fear:  Just edit dmi_config.yml
