###### Code Of Conduct: Short and Sweet Edition

Our community has origins on /vg/ on a well known Korean photoplank. As such, the tone of language here may be more crass than you are used to.

With this in mind, don't be an arse to someone and expect them to treat you like royalty. If you shit on them, they'll shit back harder.

If this sort of language offends you in any way then please go away or grow thicker skin, whichever is easier for you. It only affects you if you stick around.

Beyond that, we welcome absolutely anyone to learn to code with our mess of an engine to contribute to our mess of a game, and are happy to help you learn to hate BYOND as much as we do.

**Welcome to the team.**
