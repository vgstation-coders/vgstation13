== SELF LABELLING PRs ==
You can now self-label your PR! The syntax is simple. Just put [<labeltag>] anywhere in your PR,
where <labeltag> is to be replaced by one of the following (allowing with the resultant tag)
just ctrl+f the list or something. I know it's long.

## What this does
<!-- Describe here all changes included in the PR. -->
<!-- If the PR addresses existing issues, here is where you would write "Closes #99999". See https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue -->

## Why it's good
<!-- Explain why you think these changes are good. -->

## Changelog
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix, and delete unneeded ones. Prefixes correspond to specific icons in the generated changelog. -->
<!-- Changelogs should represent how a player might be affected by the changes, not a summary of the PR's contents. -->
<!-- If the PR has little or no impact on how players experience the game then the entire Changelog section, including the heading and content, can be left out. -->
<!-- NOTE that anything *after* the :cl: will be parsed as a changelog, if it somehow manages to be parseable as such, so always put the changelog at the VERY end! -->
