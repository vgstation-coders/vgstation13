Minimap creation guide by Deity Link. (December 11th, 2014)


So you've finally managed to create your own station map and it has reached the point where it only needs minor tweaks and is playable.
That's good, so if you're reading this that means you want your brand new station to have its own minimap for the Station Map PDA app (and maybe other uses).
Here's the long yet effective prodecure to make one:

1-When in game and on your station's Z-level, click "Generate NanoUI Map" under the Server tab.
2-Watch the Dream Daemon logs until it finishes processing all the Z-level.
2-You'll find the resulting PNG under \AppData\Roaming\BYOND\cache probably named "nanomap1.png"
3-Open station_minimaps.xcf (requires Gimp) and drag and drop the PNG onto it.
4-Turn it into its own layer, then resize it to 256x256 (or whatever are the dimensions of your map. 1 tile will be 1 pixel) IMPORTANT: Set "Interpolation" to "none" or the result will be blury and hard to work with.
5-Rename the layer "background-<shortnameofyourstation>" (which you have defined in maps/<nameofyourstation>.dm)
6-Use the colour selection tool to turn all the space tiles pitch black
7-For the rest of the tiles, equip your pencil, and go at it manually. Look at the other background layers to understand the norms.

cue 2 hours of drawing depending on how complicated your map is

8-Add inner- and outter- layers, set the inner- layer's mode to "Grain merge"
9-Add a colours-layer and start painting while following the same norms and colours as the other colours- layers. When you're done, set the colours- layer's transparency to 29,7
10-Export the result to \icons\pda_icons, and you're done! The minimap should now properly display on the app. Remember to make a clean compile.
